# ValueU & QuantityU

## Introduction

ValueU & QuantityU is a Python package designed to handle numerical values with asymmetric uncertainty and physical units. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing uncertainties in scientific computations, extending traditional numerical representations with robust error propagation and unit management.

### Key Features

- **ValueU**: Handles numerical values with asymmetric uncertainties.
- **QuantityU**: Extends ValueU by incorporating unit management using `Astropy`.
- Supports arithmetic operations with proper uncertainty propagation.
- Provides various comparison and formatting methods.
- Includes built-in documentation accessible via `.help()`.

## Installation

Currently, the package is in the alpha stage and requires manual installation. To import it, follow:

```python
## we will update here soon
```

## Usage

### Accessing Documentation

To view detailed usage instructions for `ValueU` and `QuantityU`, use the built-in help function:

```python
ValueU().help()  # Displays detailed information on ValueU
QuantityU().help()  # Displays detailed information on QuantityU
```

These commands provide comprehensive details about object creation, mathematical operations, unit conversions, comparisons, and additional functionalities.
