            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.
         
               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

OS-Climate Transformer Pre-Steps Tool
=====================================

.. _notes:

This code provides you with a cli tool with the possibility to extract data from
a pdf to a json document and to create a training data set for a later usage in the
context of transformer models
to extract relevant information, but it can also be used independently.

Quick start
============

Install via PyPi
----------------

You can simply install the package via::

    $ pip install osc-transformer-presteps

Afterwards, you can use the tooling as a CLI tool by typing::

    $ osc-transformer-presteps

We are using Typer to provide a user-friendly CLI. All details and help will be shown within the CLI itself and are not described here in more detail.

Example 1: Extracting Data from PDFs
------------------------------------

Assume the folder structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    ├-input/
    │ ├-file_1.pdf
    │ ├-file_2.pdf
    │ └─file_3.pdf
    ├-logs/
    └─output/

Now, after installing ``osc-transformer-presteps``, run the following command to extract data from the PDFs to JSON::

    $ osc-transformer-presteps extraction run-local-extraction 'input' --output-folder='output' --logs-folder='logs' --force

Note: The ``--force`` flag overcomes encryption. Please check if this is a legal action in your jurisdiction.

Example 2: Curating a New Training Data Set for Relevance Detector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform curation, you will need a KPI mapping file and an annotations file. Here are examples of such files:

**KPI Mapping File**:

.. list-table:: kpi_mapping.csv
   :header-rows: 1

   * - kpi_id
     - question
     - sectors
     - add_year
     - kpi_category
   * - 0
     - What is the company name?
     - "OG, CM, CU"
     - FALSE
     - TEXT

* **kpi_id**: The unique identifier for each KPI.
* **question**: The specific question being asked to extract relevant information.
* **sectors**: The industry sectors to which the KPI applies.
* **add_year**: Indicates whether to include the year in the extracted data (TRUE/FALSE).
* **kpi_category**: The category of the KPI, typically specifying the data type (e.g., TEXT).

**Annotation File**:

.. list-table:: annotations_file.xlsx
   :header-rows: 1

   * - company
     - source_file
     - source_page
     - kpi_id
     - year
     - answer
     - data_type
     - relevant_paragraphs
     - annotator
     - sector
   * - Royal Dutch Shell plc
     - Test.pdf
     - [1]
     - 1
     - 2019
     - 2019
     - TEXT
     - ["Sustainability Report 2019"]
     - 1qbit_edited_kpi_extraction_Carolin.xlsx
     - OG

* **company**: The name of the company being analyzed.
* **source_file**: The document from which data is extracted.
* **source_page**: The page number(s) containing the relevant information.
* **kpi_id**: The ID of the KPI associated with the data.
* **year**: The year to which the data refers.
* **answer**: The specific data or text extracted as an answer.
* **data_type**: The type of the extracted data (e.g., TEXT or TABLE).
* **relevant_paragraphs**: The paragraph(s) or context where the data was found.
* **annotator**: The person or tool that performed the annotation.
* **sector**: The industry sector the company belongs to.


You can find demo files in the ``demo/curation/input`` folder.

Assume the folder structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    ├-input/
    │ ├-data_from_extraction/
    │ │ ├-file_1.json
    │ │ ├-file_2.json
    │ │ └─file_3.json
    │ ├-kpi_mapping/
    │ │ └─kpi_mapping.csv
    │ ├-annotations_file/
    │ │ └─annotations_file.xlsx
    ├-logs/
    └─output/

Now, you can run the following command to curate a new training data set::

    $ osc-transformer-presteps relevance-curation run-local-curation 'input/-data_from_extraction/file_1.json' 'input/annotations_file/annotations_file.xlsx' 'input/kpi_mapping/kpi_mapping.csv'

Note: The previous comment may need some adjustment when running on different machine like windows due to the slash.


Example 3: Curating a New Training Data Set for KPI Detector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To perform curation, you will need the extracted json files and kpi mappinf file and annotations file (the same as described above).

Assume the folder structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    ├-input/
    │ ├-data_from_extraction/
    │ │ ├-file_1.json
    │ │ ├-file_2.json
    │ │ └─file_3.json
    │ ├-kpi_mapping/
    │ │ └─kpi_mapping.csv
    │ ├-annotations_file/
    │ │ └─annotations_file.xlsx
    │ ├-relevance_detection_file/
    │ │ └─relevance_detection.csv
    ├-logs/
    └─output/

Now, you can run the following command to curate a new training data set::

    $ osc-transformer-presteps kpi-curation run-local-kpi-curation  'input/annotations_file/' 'input/data_from_extraction/' 'output/' 'kpi_mapping/kpi_mapping_file.csv' 'relevance_detection_file/relevance_file.xlsx'  --val-ratio 0.2 --agg-annotation "" --find-new-answerable --create-unanswerable

Note: The previous comment may need some adjustment when running on different machine like windows due to the slash.

.. _Important Note on Annotations:

Important Note on Annotations
-------------------------------

When performing curation, it is crucial that all JSON files used for this process are listed in the ``demo/curation/input/test_annotation.xlsx`` file. Failure to include these files in the annotation file will result in corrupted output.

Ensure that every JSON file involved in the curation process is mentioned in the annotation file to maintain the integrity of the resulting output.


Developer space
================

Use Code Directly Without CLI via Github Repository
-----------------------------------------------------

First, clone the repository to your local environment::

    $ git clone https://github.com/os-climate/osc-transformer-presteps

We are using ``pdm`` to manage the packages and ``tox`` for a stable test framework.
First, install ``pdm`` (possibly in a virtual environment) via::

    $ pip install pdm

Afterwards, sync your system via::

    $ pdm sync

You will find multiple demos on how to proceed in the ``demo`` folder.

pdm
---

To add new dependencies, use ``pdm``. For example, you can add numpy via::

    $ pdm add numpy

For more detailed descriptions, check the `PDM project homepage <https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/>`_.

For running linting tools, we use ``tox``. You can run this outside of your virtual environment::

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox -e lint
    $ tox -e test

This will automatically apply checks on your code and run the provided pytests. See more details on `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/4.16.0/>`_.
