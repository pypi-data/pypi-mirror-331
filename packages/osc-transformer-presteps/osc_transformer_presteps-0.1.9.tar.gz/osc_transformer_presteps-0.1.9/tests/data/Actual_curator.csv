What is the target year for climate commitment?,"We continue to work towards delivering on our Net Carbon Footprint ambition to cut the intensity of the greenhouse gas emissions of the energy products we sell by about 50% by 2050, and 20% by 2035 compared to our 2016 levels, in step with society as it moves towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In 2019, we set shorter-term targets for 2021 of 2-3% lower than our 2016 baseline Net Carbon Footprint. In early 2020, we set a Net Carbon Footprint target for 2022 of 3-4% lower than our 2016 baseline. We will continue to evolve our approach over time.",1,2050,test_annotations_sliced.xlsx,Royal Dutch Shell plc,2019,Test.pdf,['1'],0,TEXT,11
