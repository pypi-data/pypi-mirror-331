You can be logged into multiple Google accounts at the same time. If you are only logged into
one account, it will automatically be used when you click "Login with Google".

Visit [Google][google] and click your avatar in the top right corner and "Add account" and log with your Scout connected account. Next time you access Scout you will be presented with an option of which Google account to use.
