# Custom song class to use
# If you want to extract additional data when parsing files (video, subtitle or
# other), you can write your own Song class, derived from
# `dakara_feeder.song.BaseSong`. See documentation of BaseSong for more details
# on how to proceed.
# You can indicate it in various ways.
# Module only, in that case the default class name Song will be used:
# custom_song_class: my.module
# Module and a custom class name:
# custom_song_class: my.module.MySong
# File only, in that case the default class name Song will be used:
# custom_song_class: path/to/file.py
# File and a custom class name:
# custom_song_class: path/to/file.py::MySong
# Default is BaseSong, which is pretty basic.
# custom_song_class: module_name.Song

# Other parameters

# Minimal level of messages to log
# For debug level, you can call `feeder.py` with the `âˆ’d` flag to show
# traceback on exceptions.
# Default is 'info'
