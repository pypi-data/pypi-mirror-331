> [!TIP]
> Recommended wordlists, rules, and masks can be found in repositories like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) and [wpa2-wordlists](https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists.git).
   
### Installation via pip
1. **Install hashCrack with pip**:
   You can install `hashCrack` directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --no-deps hashcrack-tool
   ```
2. **Running hashCrack**:
   After installation, you can run `hashCrack` by specifying the hash file you want to crack (run`source venv/bin/activate` before executing):
   ```bash
   hashcrack hashfile
   ```

</p>
    
>[!TIP]
> **(Optional) Download default wordlists and rules**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ente0/hashcat-defaults
   cp -rf hashcat-defaults/* .
   rm -r hashcat-defaults
   ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The cracking results will be stored in `~/.hashCrack/logs/session`, specifically in `status.txt`.

## Attack Modes
hashCrack supports the following attack modes:
| # | Mode                 | Description                                                                                   |
|---|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | Straight             | Uses a wordlist directly to attempt cracks                                                    |
| 1 | Combination          | Combines two dictionaries to produce candidate passwords                                      |
| 3 | Brute-force          | Attempts every possible password combination based on a specified character set               |
| 6 | Hybrid Wordlist + Mask | Uses a wordlist combined with a mask to generate variations                                 |
| 7 | Hybrid Mask + Wordlist | Uses a mask combined with a wordlist for generating password candidates                     |
| 9 | Association          | For specific hash types where known data is combined with brute-force attempts                |

## Menu Options
The main menu provides easy access to various cracking methods:

| Option     | Description                | Script                          |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 (Mode 0) | Crack with Wordlist        | Executes wordlist-based cracking |
| 2 (Mode 9) | Crack with Rules           | Executes rule-based cracking |
| 3 (Mode 3) | Crack with Brute-Force     | Executes brute-force cracking |
| 4 (Mode 6) | Crack with Combinator      | Executes hybrid wordlist + mask cracking |
| 0          | Clear Hashcat Potfile      | Deletes the potfile to clear previous hash results |
| X          | Switch Current OS Menu     | Updates the menu and script settings based on the current OS |
| Q          | Quit                       | Exits the program |

### Example Commands
```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 400 example400.hash example.dict              # Wordlist
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example0.hash example.dict -r best64.rule   # Wordlist + Rules
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example0.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a                  # Brute-Force
hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example0.hash example.dict example.dict     # Combination
hashcat -a 9 -m 500 example500.hash 1word.dict -r best64.rule # Association
```

## Troubleshooting Hashcat Issues

If you encounter errors when running Hashcat, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Test Hashcat Functionality**:
   First, run a benchmark test to ensure that Hashcat is working properly:
   ```bash
   hashcat -b
   ```
   This command will perform a benchmark on your system to check Hashcat's overall functionality. If this command works without issues, Hashcat is likely properly installed.

2. **Check Available Devices**:
   To verify that Hashcat can detect your devices (such as GPUs) for cracking, use the following command:
   ```bash
   hashcat -I
   ```
   This command will list the available devices. Ensure that the correct devices are listed for use in cracking.

3. **Check for Errors in Hashcat**:
   If the cracking process fails or Hashcat doesn't seem to recognize your devices, running the above tests should help identify potential problems with your system configuration, such as missing or incompatible drivers.

4. **Permissions**:
   If you encounter permission issues (especially on Linux), consider running Hashcat with elevated privileges or configuring your user group correctly for GPU access. You can run Hashcat with `sudo` if necessary:
   ```bash
   sudo hashcat -b
   ```

## Script Walkthrough

The main hashCrack script consists of:
1. **Initialization**: Loads default parameters and reusable functions.
2. **User Prompts**: Gathers inputs from the user such as wordlist location, session names, and attack type.
3. **Command Construction**: Constructs the Hashcat command based on user inputs and specified attack mode.
4. **Execution**: Runs the cracking session with or without status timers.
5. **Logging**: Saves session results for future reference.
