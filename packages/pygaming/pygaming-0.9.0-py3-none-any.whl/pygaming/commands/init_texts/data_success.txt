The folder 'data' has been created. It will be used to store all the data about the game:
database files, settings, configs, your own files.

The folder contains several files:
---
The sql-game folder will contains every files related to the database 
At the game launch, the database is create in the temporary folder. 
 - The first script that is executed is tables.sql. This script initialize the tables of the database.
 - Then, every other sql files (but ig_queries.sql) are executed one by one, in the alphabetical order.
 - The localizations.sql file contains the texts, it is used to create a game that can be played in multiple languages.
 - The speeches.sql file contains the path to the speeches in different languages (like texts but for sounds)
 - The ig_queries.sql is empty at the first game launch, but it might by filled during the game use by insert queries.
 - All these sql scripts will be executed in the game database.
The sql-server folder contains the same files but localizations.sql and speeches.sql, they are executed the same way when the server is launched.
---
The settings.json file is used to store the settings.
This file is modified when the user pause the game to change some settings.
Fill the file with your own default settings, then call them with the setting class.
---
The config.json file is used to store permanent settings, like default values.
---
Use the data folder to store the other data of your game: sessions, players, or objects that requires a complex save.
You can define custom DataFile classes for this, as children of the DataFile class.
