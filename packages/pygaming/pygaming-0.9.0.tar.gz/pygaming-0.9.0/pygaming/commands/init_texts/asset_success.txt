The folder 'assets' has been created. It will be used to store all the assets of the game:
musics, sounds, fonts and images

The folder contains several subfolders and files:
----
The default icon is pygaming's icon, rememeber to replace this file with your own icon.
To create a .icon file, use the image software you want (e.g : microsoft paint) to create your own icon,
then convert into an .ico file (you can use online converters) and be sure to name it 'icon.ico'.
----
The musics, sounds, fonts and images folders will be used by you to store the different assets of the game.
You can load them by using the FontFile, MusicFile, SoundFile and ImageFile to load them in the game.
----
The musics folder contains all the musics you will play during the game. They can be played in two different ways:
- with a loop by using jukebox.play_loop(name, loop_instant (in ms))
- with playlists with jukebox.read_playlist(list[name], random: bool)
Here, names are the path to the music file into the musics folder.
Ex: if the musics folder contains one music called 'background_music.mp3', the name is 'background_music.mp3'
if the music folder contains several folders with musics in it, the name is 'folder/music.mp3
----
The sounds folder contains all the sounds to be played. To have acces to them, you should have a line in the data/sql-game/sounds.sql file
Each line is composed of:
- name, that is the identifier of the sounds to be used to play the sound
- phase_name: the name of the phase (or 'all') in which the sound will be played
- sound_path: the path of the sounds in the assets/sound folder
- category: the category of the sounds that must match the data.settings.json document
