**************

* fix wrong import with optional dependencies

Version 0.9.1
**************

* fix dumping of fitresult in test, require ASDF version < 1.6.0 in writing to file
* fix sampling of model in FrequentistCalculator with simultaneous fits


Version 0.9.0
**************

* Add support for Python 3.13

Version 0.8.1
**************

* Add support for Python 3.12, drop support for Python 3.8
* Improved support for zfit 0.20+

Thanks to @MoritzNeuberger for finding and proposing a hypothesis test fix.

Version 0.7.0
*************

* Add support for Python 3.11, drop support for Python 3.7

Version 0.6.1
*************

* fix toy generation with constraints

Version 0.6.0
*************

* Upgrade to Python 3.10 and zfit >= 0.10.0
* Enhanced speed toy limit calculation
* Add multidimensionl PDF support
* Add support for binned data and models

Version 0.5.0
*************
* Upgrade to Python 3.9 and drop support for 3.6

Version 0.4.0
*************
* loss: upgrade API to use ``create_new`` to make sure that the losses are comparable. Compatible with zfit 0.6.4+

Version 0.3.1
*************
* sPlot: Increase the tolerance of the sanity check from 1e-3 to 5e-2, if above the tolerance a ModelNotFittedToData
  exception is raised. In addition if the the check is above the 5e-3 tolerance a warning message is printed.


Version 0.3.0
*************
* New documentation style
* **hepstats** can now do hypothesis tests, and compute upper limits and confidence intervals for counting analysis
* Progess bars are used to see the progression of the generation of the toys

Version 0.2.5
*************
* ConfidenceInterval can compute Feldman and Cousin intervals with boundaries (i.e ``qtilde=True``)
* **AsymptoticCalculator** asymov weights are now scaled to the number of entries in dataset from loss
  function if the loss is not extended
* **hepstats.hypotests** can now be used even if there is no nuisances. The **pll** function in **utils/fit/diverse.py**
  had to be modified such that if there are no nuisances, the **pll** function returns the value of the loss function.
* add notebooks demos for FC intervals with the ``FrequentistCalculator`` and ``AsymptoticCalculator``.
* add warnings when multiple roots are found in ``ConfidenceInterval``
* move toys .yml files from notebook to notebook/toys

Version 0.2.4
*************
* Redesigned packaging system, GHA deployment.
* **expected_poi** removed from **BaseCalculator** and **AsymptoticCalculator**
* add type checks in the **hypotests** submodule

Version 0.2.3
**************
* **hepstats** is now compatible with zfit > 0.5 api
* expected intervals in upper limit are now calculated from the pvalues and not from the **expected_poi**
  function anymore.

Version 0.2.2
**************
* Addition of the **sPlot** algorithm

Version 0.2.1
**************
* Addition of the **FrequentistCalculator** to performs hypothesis test, upper limit and interval calculations
  with toys. Toys can be saved and loaded in / from yaml files using the methods:

   * ``to_yaml``
   * ``from_yaml``

Version 0.2.0
**************
* New version for the new **hepstats** name of the package

Version 0.1.3
**************
* Package name changed from **scikit*stats** to **hepstats**

Version 0.1.2
**************
* Additions of classes to compute upper limits and confidence intervals.

Version 0.1.1
**************
* Release for Zenodo DOI

Version 0.1.0
**************
* First release of **scikit*stats**
* Addition of the **modeling** submodule with the ``Bayesian Blocks algorithm``
* Addition of the **hypotests** submodule
