For bug fixes or new features, please file an issue before submitting a
pull request. If the change isn't trivial, it may be best to wait for
feedback.

## Coding guidelines

### Versions

This project targets Python 3.7 or later.

Python objects should be typed; since it is not supported by Cython,
you must manually declare types in type stubs (`.pyi` files). In Python
files, you can add type annotations to function signatures (supported in
Python 3.5) and in variable assignments (supported only from Python
3.6 onward).

### Interfacing with C

When interfacing with C, and in particular with pointers, use assertions
everywhere you assume the pointer to be non-NULL. Also consider using
assertions when accessing raw C arrays, if applicable.

## Setting up a local repository

Make sure you clone the repository in recursive mode, so you also get the
wrapped code of Prodigal which is exposed as a ``git`` submodule:

```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal
```

## Running tests

Tests are written as usual Python unit tests with the `unittest` module of
the standard library. Running them requires the extension to be built
locally:

```console
$ python -m pip install -v -e . --no-build-isolation
$ python -m unittest -vv pyrodigal.tests
```

## Running benchmarks

### Connection scoring

The `benches` folder contains benchmarks for evaluating the performance of
the node connection scoring step, essentially to make sure that the SIMD
code makes it faster.

Start by building `pyrodigal` locally:
```console
$ python -m pip install -v . --no-build-isolation
```

Then make sure you have the required packages and data:
```console
$ pip install --user -r benches/connection_scoring/requirements.txt
$ python benches/connection_scoring/data/download.py
```

Finally, run the benchmarks and plot the results:
```console
$ python benches/connection_scoring/bench.py -d benches/connection_scoring/data/ -o times.json
$ python benches/connection_scoring/plot.py -i times.json --show
```

## Setting up the Prodigal comparison

[Julian Hahnfeld](https://github.com/jhahnfeld) has developed a pipeline for
comparing Pyrodigal and Prodigal to make sure they produce exactly the
same results on a set of genomes: https://github.com/jhahnfeld/prodigal-pyrodigal-comparison

To use it, first install the local version of Pyrodigal that you want to compare against
Prodigal:
```console
$ pip install --user . --no-build-isolation --force-reinstall
```

Then compile the patched Prodigal binary from the code that is
ditributed with Pyrodigal:
```console
$ make -C vendor/Prodigal/
```

Finally, clone the comparison repository, download example genomes, and run
the comparison:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jhahnfeld/prodigal-pyrodigal-comparison
$ cd prodigal-pyrodigal-comparison
$ wget -i test_genomes.txt -P genomes
$ python compare.py --prodigal ../vendor/Prodigal/prodigal --genome genomes/*
```
