''' Qualified aliases to accretive data structures.

    Provides aliases prefixed with "Accretive" for all core classes. These are
    useful for avoiding namespace collisions when importing from the package,
    particularly with common names like "Dictionary" or "Namespace".

    For example, instead of:

    >>> from accretive import Dictionary
    >>> # Possible conflict with other Dictionary classes

    you could use:

    >>> from accretive.qaliases import AccretiveDictionary
    >>> # Clearly indicates the source and behavior
