# Introduction

Hi everyone. This is Mr. Lee and this is my first python project!

It is a collection of simple and useful utilities for file and string operations. It provides easy-to-use functions for common tasks like reading/writing files, grouping data, and regex-based string manipulation.

## Features

- **File Utilities**:
  - Read and write files in various formats (JSON, YAML, TOML, raw text).
  - Extract file extensions.
  - Automatically create directories for file paths.

- **String Utilities**:
  - Group items by keys.
  - Extract regex matches from strings.
  - Modify strings by removing matched patterns.

```bash
pip install mrlee
```

Or clone from `github`:
