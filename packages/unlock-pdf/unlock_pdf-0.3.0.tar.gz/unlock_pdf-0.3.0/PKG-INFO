# unlock_pdf 

This is a command-line tool that wraps around pikepdf to provide a convenient way to remove editing restrictions on PDFs with a write restriction but without a password.

## Installation
### Installing with uv (Recommended)
uv automatically places the `unlock_pdf` command into PATH and puts it in a persistent environment such that it can be accessed everywhere from the terminal.
```
uv tool install unlock_pdf
```

### Insatlling with PyPI
If you prefer to have it in one specific environment, you can install with pip as well.
```
pip install unlock_pdf
```

## Examples
Examples below are demonstrated assuming a installation with uv. You may use the following 
To unlock 1 pdf:
```
$ unlock_pdf path/to/pdf 
```

### Directory flag
To unlock all pdf's within a directory you will need to call the `-d` flag.
```
$ unlock_pdf path/to/folder -d
```

### Suffix flag
The default behavior is to add `_unlocked` at the end of the filename.
To change this, use the `-s` flag:
```
$ unlock_pdf path/to/pdf -d -s "_new"
```
