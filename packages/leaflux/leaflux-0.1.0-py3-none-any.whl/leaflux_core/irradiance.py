class RelativeIrradiance:
    """
    Class that holds the output relative irradiance for the terrain surface, and if the 
    canopy inclusive irradiance model was run, the canopy irradiance as well.

    Attributes
    ----------
    leaf_irradiance: np.ndarray
        Holds the coordinates and relative irradiance for the canopy. 
    terrain_irradiance: np.ndarray
        Holds the terrain coordinates and their relative irradiance. Is a numpy array
        with shape (width, height), where each (x, y) coordiante holds the irradiance
        value for that point on the terrain.
