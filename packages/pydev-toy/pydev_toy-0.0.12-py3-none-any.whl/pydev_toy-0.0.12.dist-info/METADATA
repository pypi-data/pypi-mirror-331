# Command line util to manage python projects 

Command line utility to manage standard `pyproject.toml` based projects.
The interface is built with `click` and can run multiple commands in sequence.

```console
pydev clean build dump
```

This project is exploratory and may be usefull as a basis for custom workflows.
The library uses standard python packaging tools like `build` and `twine`
and works independently from the build backend.

  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build    Build project wheel
  bump     Bump static version in pyproject.toml
  clean    Delete build and dist folders
  dump     Dump wheel and sdist contents
  info     Project info including pypi versions
  prune    Delete all runtime folders
