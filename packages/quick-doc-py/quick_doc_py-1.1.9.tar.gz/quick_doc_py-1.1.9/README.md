## Thanks for using [quick-doc-py](https://pypi.org/project/quick-doc-py). If you like this project, you can support it on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/draggamestudio). Your support helps improve the project and add new features. Thank you!
Quick-doc-py is a Python library that automates the documentation generation for any project or code. This tool is designed to make the process of creating project documentation simple and efficient. It can create Markdown documentation, which is easy to read and can be easily converted to other formats (like HTML) if needed.

Features:
- Generate documentation for code files
- Supports multiple languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, Spanish, Polish)
- Integration of gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo for better code explanation
- Simple command line interface

Structure:
Quick-doc-py consists of multiple Python modules. The main `quick_doc_py` directory contains:

- `config.py`: It includes configuration settings, language-to-index mapping, and lists of ignored files.
- `log_logic/req.py`: Contains the `ReqToServer` class that is responsible for interactions and data exchange with the server (if needed).
- `utilities.py`: Contains utility classes and decorators, such as `ProgressBar`, `TimeManager`, and so on.
- `main.py`: It is the entry point of the application, including classes like `ReqHendler`, `GptHandler`, `AnswerHandler`, and `AutoDock`.
- `providers_test.py`: It includes the `ProviderTest` class which is used to test the compatibility between gpt-4/gpt-3.5-turbo and different providers.

Usage:
To generate project documentation, you need to do the following steps:

1. Install quick-doc-py via pip:
```
pip install quick-doc-py
```

2. Run the command, specifying required arguments. You can see a configurable example below:
```
python -m quick_doc_py \
  --name_project "My Project" \
  --root_dir "./my_project" \
  --ignore '["*README.md", "*__pycache__", "*dist"]' \
  --languages '[(en,), (ru,), (ua,)]' \
  --gpt_version "gpt-4" \
  --provider "Mhystical" \
  --general_prompt "Write general idea of code in Markdown (use Google Style) in en language write only about Overview, Features, Structure, Usage. Dont add ```markdown. Dont invent code talk only about that code." \
  --default_prompt "Write documentation for this file in Markdown (use Google Style) in en language. Write only about usage and describe every methods. Remember that it is not full documentation, it is just addition. Dont add ```markdown. Dont invent code talk only about that code."
```

This command will generate project documentation by using gpt-4 and the Mhystical provider. Quick-doc-py will also create separate Markdown files for each language specified.

# Documentation for `./quick_doc_py/providers_test.py`

This file provides a set of classes and functions for testing different LLM providers using the G4F (Gutenburg 4 Foundation) chat completion library. The primary objective is to determine if a given provider works and returns expected results.

## Usage

To use this file, first install the required packages (`g4f`, `colorama`, and `argparse`) with the following terminal command:

```bash
pip install g4f colorama argparse
```

Next, create an instance of the `ProviderTest` class by specifying the desired model name. The `main()` function serves as the entry point for the script and accepts a `--name_model` argument for the model name.

```bash
python providers_test.py --name_model "gpt-4"
```

This will test all the available LLM providers and print the successful results, which indicates that the provider is functional and works for the desired model.

## Classes and Methods

### `TextStyle` class

The `TextStyle` class allows custom text styling with color and background support. It uses the `colorama` library for formatting.

- __`get_text(text: str, color: any = "", back: any = "") -> str:`__ This method takes in a text string and optional color and background attributes. It returns the formatted text with the specified style.

### `ProgressBar` class

The `ProgressBar` class provides a simple progress bar mechanism.

- __`__init__(self, part) -> None:`__ This constructor initializes a new progress bar instance with the total count of parts.
- __`progress(self, name):`__ This method updates the progress bar with the given status name.

### `ProviderTest` class

The `ProviderTest` class encapsulates the logic for testing different LLM providers.

- __`__init__(self, model_name: str) -> None:`__ This constructor initializes a new provider test instance with the given model name.
- __`get_providers(self):`__ This method obtains a list of all available provider names from the `g4f.Provider` module.
- __`test_provioder(self, provider_name: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:`__ This method tests if a given provider works with the specified model. It returns a tuple that contains a boolean indicating if the provider works and the response from the test.
- __`test_provider_timeout(self, provider):`__ This method tests a given provider with a timeout control. If the test is successful, it returns the response; otherwise, it returns `None`.
- __`test_providers(self):`__ This method tests all the available providers and stores the ones that work with the specified model.

### Functions

- __`provider_test(model_name: str) -> dict:`__ This function creates an instance of the `ProviderTest` class and tests all the available providers using the given model name.
- __`main():`__ This function parses command line arguments and executes the `provider_test` function with the given model name.

That's the end of the documentation for `./quick_doc_py/providers_test.py` file.
# utilities.py

This document describes the usage of methods present in the `utilities.py` file. The purpose of this file is to provide different helper functions and classes which can be used in various use cases.

## Classes and Functions

### TextStyle

The `TextStyle` class is defined to handle text styles and colors, using the `colorama` library. Here's how to make use of it:

- `__init__()` method: Initializes the `colorama` library.

- `get_text(text, color, back)` method: Returns a colored text based on the `color` and `back` arguments. The `color` and `back` require arguments from the `colorama` library like `Fore`, `Back`, and `Style`. The `text` should be any valid string.

### ProgressBar

The `ProgressBar` class is designed to create and manage a progress bar in the terminal. Here's how to use it:

- `__init__(self, part)` method: Initializes the `ProgressBar` object with a given value `part`.

- `progress(self, name)` method: Updates the progress bar by printing the progress percentage and the message in the terminal. It requires a `name` parameter that represents the task being displayed.

### Functions

- `start(part)`: Starts the progress bar. Requires a `part` parameter that determines the progress calculation.

- `time_manager(func)`: A decorator function for time measurement. It measures the time taken by the given function (`func`) and updates the progress bar accordingly.

Formula for progress calculation:

  *progress = math.ceil(len / 100 * procent)*

## Usage Example

```python
import time

from utilities import start, time_manager, ProgressBar, TextStyle

bar = ProgressBar(part=0)

@time_manager
def dummy():
    time.sleep(1)

# Start the progress bar
start(part=0)

# Run the dummy function
dummy()

# End the progress bar
bar = ProgressBar(part=1)
```

This example demonstrates how to start the progress bar using the `start()` function, define a decorated function using `time_manager()`, and then managing the progress with the `ProgressBar` class. The `dummy()` function here is just an example and will not actually perform any meaningful operation in this case.
