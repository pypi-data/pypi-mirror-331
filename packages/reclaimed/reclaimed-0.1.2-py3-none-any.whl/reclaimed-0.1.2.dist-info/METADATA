# reclaimed üåü

A powerful and user-friendly command-line tool for analyzing disk usage, with special handling for iCloud storage on macOS. Quickly find your largest files and directories with a beautiful, color-coded interface. I let aider write the README.md boilerplate and it's all accurate but I'm still not sure how we feel about the emojis... it seems Claude is a colorful gentleman when writing markdown.

## Features

- üöÄ Fast recursive directory scanning, legitimately performant and batches progress updates efficently 
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Smart detection of iCloud vs local storage which is nice on the macbook
- üìä She pretty (it utilizes the [Textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library for fancy CLI stylings)
- üíæ Export results to JSON for further analysis or batch operations
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Real-time progress indication actually great
- üõ°Ô∏è Graceful handling of permission issues, doesn't freeze like the old diskinventoryx

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/reclaimed.git
cd reclaimed
pip install -r requirements.txt
hatch shell
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
reclaimed ~/Documents
```

Advanced options:
```bash
# Show more results
reclaimed ~/Documents --files 20 --dirs 15

# Save results to JSON
reclaimed ~/Documents --output results.json
```

### Options

- `PATH`: Directory to scan (default: current directory)
- `-f, --files N`: Number of largest files to show (default: 10)
- `-d, --dirs N`: Number of largest directories to show (default: 10)
- `-o, --output FILE`: Save results to JSON file

## Output

The tool provides:
- A real-time progress indicator showing files scanned and total size
- Two tables showing the largest files and directories
- Clear indication of iCloud vs local storage
- Summary of any access issues encountered

## Development

This project uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development workflow management.
