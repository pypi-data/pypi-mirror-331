About
=====
``pyunicorn`` (**Uni**\ fied **Co**\ mplex Network and **R**\ ecurre\ **N**\ ce
analysis toolbox) is an object-oriented Python package for the advanced analysis
and modeling of complex networks. Beyond the standard **measures of complex
network theory** (such as *degree*, *betweenness* and *clustering coefficients*), it
provides some uncommon but interesting statistics like *Newman's random walk
betweenness*. ``pyunicorn`` also provides novel **node-weighted** *(node splitting invariant)*
network statistics, measures for analyzing networks of **interacting/interdependent
networks**, and special tools to model **spatially embedded** complex networks.

Moreover, ``pyunicorn`` allows one to easily *construct networks* from uni- and
multivariate time series and event data (**functional/climate networks** and
**recurrence networks**). This involves linear and nonlinear measures of
**time series analysis** for constructing functional networks from multivariate data
(e.g., *Pearson correlation*, *mutual information*, *event synchronization* and *event
coincidence analysis*). ``pyunicorn`` also features modern techniques of
nonlinear analysis of time series (or pairs thereof), such as *recurrence
quantification analysis* (RQA), *recurrence network analysis* and *visibility
graphs*.

``pyunicorn`` is **fast**, because all costly computations are performed in
compiled C code. It can handle **large networks** through the
use of sparse data structures. The package can be used interactively, from any
Python script, and even for parallel computations on large cluster architectures.

Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
Official releases
.................
`Stable releases <https://pypi.org/project/pyunicorn/#history>`_ can be
installed directly from the `Python Package Index (PyPI)
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi>`_::

    $> pip install pyunicorn

Alternatively, source distributions can be downloaded from the
`GitHub Releases <https://github.com/pik-copan/pyunicorn/releases>`_.

On **Windows**, please *first* install the latest version of the `Microsoft C++ Build
Tools <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_, which is required for
compiling Cython modules.

Current development version
...........................
In order to use a `newer version <https://github.com/pik-copan/pyunicorn>`_,
please follow the ``pip`` instructions for installing from `version control
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-vcs>`_
or from a `local source tree
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-a-local-src-tree>`_.

Dependencies
............
``pyunicorn`` is implemented in `Python 3 <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_ /
`Cython 3 <https://cython.org/>`_, is `tested
<https://app.travis-ci.com/github/pik-copan/pyunicorn>`_ on *Linux*, *macOS*
and *Windows*, and relies on the following packages:

- Required:

  - `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
  - `python-igraph <http://igraph.org/>`_ (for ``Network``)
  - `h5netcdf <https://h5netcdf.org/>`_ (for ``Data``, ``NetCDFDictionary``)
  - `tqdm <https://tqdm.github.io/>`_ (for progress bars)

- Optional:

  - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_,
    `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_
    (for plotting features)
  - `mpi4py <https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py>`_
    (for parallelizing costly computations)
  - `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
    (for generating documentation)
  - `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    (for tutorial notebooks)


Documentation
-------------
For extensive HTML documentation, jump right to the `homepage
<http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~donges/pyunicorn/>`_. In a local source tree,
HTML and PDF documentation can be generated using ``Sphinx``::

    $> pip install .[docs]
    $> cd docs; make clean html latexpdf

Tuturials
---------

For some example applications look into the
`tutorials <docs/source/examples/tutorials/>`_ provided with the documentation.
They are designed to be self-explanatory, and are set up as Jupyter notebooks.

Development
===========

Test suite
----------
Before committing changes or opening a pull request (PR) to the code base,
please make sure that all tests pass. The test suite is managed by `tox
<https://tox.wiki/>`_ and is configured to use system-wide packages
when available. Install the test dependencies as follows::

    $> pip install -e .[tests]

The test suite can be run from anywhere in the project tree by issuing::

    $> tox

To display the defined test environments and target them individually::

    $> tox -l
    $> tox -e style,lint,test,docs

To test individual files::

    $> flake8 src/pyunicorn/core/network.py     # style check
    $> pylint src/pyunicorn/core/network.py     # static code analysis
    $> pytest tests/test_core/test_network.py   # unit tests
