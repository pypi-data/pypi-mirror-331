    Class RecurrencePlot for generating and quantitatively analyzing
    :index:`recurrence plots <single: recurrence plot>`.

    The RecurrencePlot class supports the construction of recurrence plots
    from multi-dimensional time series, optionally using embedding. Currently,
    manhattan, euclidean and supremum norms are provided for measuring
    distances in phase space.

    Methods for calculating commonly used measures of :index:`recurrence
    quantification analysis <pair: RQA; recurrence plot>` (RQA) are provided,
    e.g., determinism, maximum diagonal line length and laminarity. The
    definitions of these measures together with a review of the theory and
    applications of recurrence plots are given in [Marwan2007]_.

    **Examples:**

     - Create an instance of RecurrencePlot with a fixed recurrence threshold
       and without embedding::

           RecurrencePlot(time_series, threshold=0.1)

     - Create an instance of RecurrencePlot with a fixed recurrence threshold
       in units of STD and without embedding::

           RecurrencePlot(time_series, threshold_std=0.03)

     - Create an instance of RecurrencePlot at a fixed (global) recurrence rate
       and using time delay embedding::

           RecurrencePlot(time_series, dim=3, tau=2,
                          recurrence_rate=0.05).recurrence_rate()
