# Kriptex Library

Kriptex library is actually developed to create encrypted files more easily and using a symbol-based method by using the Kriptex cipher structure in the DaVinci cipher book on the computer.

You can use the special symbol-based encryption method for Kriptex or you can encrypt directly with other encryption algorithms.
