## Environment Configuration

To use this library successfully, ensure your environment is properly configured.

### `.env` File Requirements
In the directory where your code is executed (or in any higher-level directory in the folder tree), there must be a 
`.env` file containing the required configuration.

#### Example
You can reference the structure and contents of a valid `.env` file in the provided `.env.example` file.

### Alternative Location
Alternatively, the `.env` file can be located in the `babylon` directory under the following path:

```
babylon/BUILD/.env
```

Ensure this file contains all necessary environment variables for the library to function properly.

## Notes

- Make sure your `.env` file or `babylon/BUILD/.env` file is properly set up before running your project to avoid 
runtime errors.
- Always keep your tokens and sensitive information secure.
