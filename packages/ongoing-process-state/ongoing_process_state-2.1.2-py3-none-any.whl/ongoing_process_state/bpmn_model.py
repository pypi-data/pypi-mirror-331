        node remain advanced.

        For example, imagine marking={1,2}, {1} advances to {3} and {4}, and {2} advances to {5} and {6}.

        For this, the method has to find the smaller combination of branches that, when advanced isolated, enable the
        desired node. Then, identify the remaining branches, advance them individually, and rollback such advancement.
