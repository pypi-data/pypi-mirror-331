# BrickCLI

BrickCLI is a Python command-line interface (CLI) library designed to automate the creation of files and directories for projects following the Clean Architecture principles. It simplifies project scaffolding, making it faster and more consistent.

## Installation

You can install BrickCLI using pip or Poetry:

```sh
pip install brick-cli
```

or using Poetry:

```sh
poetry add brick-cli
```

## Usage

After installing BrickCLI, you can use it to quickly generate the necessary structure for your projects. Example usage:

```sh
brick create-project
```

and creating a repository:

```sh
brick create-repository user
```

This command will create the necessary files and directories for a "user" module based on Clean Architecture.

More detailed usage instructions and available commands will be provided in the documentation.
