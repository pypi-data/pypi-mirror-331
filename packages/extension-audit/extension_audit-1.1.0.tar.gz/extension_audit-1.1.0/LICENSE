The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take 
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General 
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all 
versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

This license, the Affero General Public License, is designed specifically to 
ensure that, in the case of software used on a network server, users retain 
freedom to get the source code of the software they’re interacting with.
