- Duplicate \usepackage[all]{xy}: The package xy is loaded twice, once within the main \usepackage line and again separately.
- Usage of \begin{align} in Non-Math Environments: Using \begin{align} inside figure captions and text is incorrect. This should be plain text or wrapped in $...$ for inline math.
- Improper Math Mode Usage in Text: In figure labels and captions, such as \begin{align} x \end{align} should be $x$.
- Misplaced Commands: Commands like \mathbb{R} and \Rightarrow should be used within math mode.
- Incomplete Definitions: The definitions of \mathbb{B}_r and similar symbols are used without being wrapped in math mode $.
- Overuse of \begin{align}: There is an overuse of the align environment for simple inline math that should use $...$.
- Improper Usage of \begin{figure}[h] and [h] vs. [H]: [h] should be used instead of [H] for figure placement to avoid potential issues with the float package.
- Improper Nesting of Environments: Make sure \begin{enumerate} and other environments are correctly nested and closed.
- Unnecessary Bold in Theorems and Definitions: The use of \textbf{Definition 2.1} within the \begin{definition}...\end{definition} environment is redundant.
- Use of \qed Instead of Closing Proof Environment: Ensure that all proofs are properly opened with \begin{proof} and closed with \end{proof} rather than using \qed.
- Misplaced \tableofcontents: Itâ€™s placed after \maketitle, which is correct, but might need to adjust to ensure proper page numbering.
- Redundant Loading of TikZ Libraries: Libraries calc and tikz-cd are loaded twice.
- Misuse of \def vs. \newcommand: \def is used instead of \newcommand which is more appropriate for user-defined commands.
- Unused Imports: Ensure all imported packages are necessary.
- No New Line for \section: Ensure proper spacing and new lines before \section and \subsection commands.
- Math Mode in Section Titles: Section titles containing math, such as \section{The Topology of \mathbb{R}^n}, should ensure proper math mode within titles.
- Undefined Control Sequences: Ensure all used commands and symbols are defined or included within the appropriate package.
- Caption Outside Float Environment: Ensure \caption is used within a proper float environment such as figure.
- Potential Overlapping and Incorrect Spacing: Use of \titlespacing* might need adjustments to ensure no overlapping or awkward spacing in the document.
- Avoid: Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
- Avoid: Missing number, treated as zero.
- You can't use `\raise' in vertical mode.
- Avoid: Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
- Avoid: Runaway argument?
- Avoid: Argument of \xP@rotate@ has an extra }
- Avoid: Illegal parameter number in definition of \Hy@tempa.
- Avoid: Extra \endgroup.
- Avoid: Too many }'s.
- Avoid: Extra \endgroup.
- Avoid: Package caption Error: \caption outside float.
- Avoid: LaTeX Error: \begin{document} ended by \end{tikzpicture}.
- Avoid: Undefined control sequence.
DO NOT INSERT ALIGN INTO FIGURES.

    r"\\begin{proof}...\\end{proof}. Use \\section{...}, \\subsection{...}, and \\subsubsection{...} to organize the document into clearly defined sections. "
    r"Ensure proper spacing between different elements and avoid redundant commands. For diagrams and photographs, describe the content briefly in LaTeX comments. "
    r"If photographs or images of text are unclear, make reasonable guesses but note these as comments. Do not include \\documentclass, \\usepackage, \\begin{document}, or \\end{document} commands in your response. "
    r"Unescaped Special Characters: Some special characters like underscores (_) and ampersands (&) need to be escaped in LaTeX. "
    r"Math Mode Delimiters: Ensure that math mode delimiters ($ or \\[...\\]) are used appropriately. "
    r"Incomplete Environments: Make sure all environments are properly opened and closed. "
    r"Overlapping Definitions: Ensure definitions are not overlapping and properly formatted. "
    r"Remove Extra Symbols and Comments: Ensure there are no residual symbols or comments that could cause LaTeX errors. "
    r"Try to link examples and proofs together. "
    r"Abstain from undefined control sequences. "
    r"When giving a definition, theorem, proposition or anything of that nature, enclose in \\textbf{...} the name of it, followed by descriptions. "
    r"Any solutions or proofs should be started with \\begin{proof} and obviously closed by \\end{proof}. "
    r"Use \\frac when discussing a fraction. "
    r"Do not use solutions unless it's clearly a problem set, use proof instead. "
    r"Use sections, subsections, newpage, subsubsection intelligently and discern how information should be organized. "
    r"Ensure all environments are properly closed: Make sure each \\begin{...} has a corresponding \\end{...}. "
    r"Ensure that there is no overflow horizontally. Do not use \\textbf{...} for unnecessary emphasis, focus on clarity and conciseness. "
    r"For figures, use the tikz package to create diagrams rather than referencing non-existent PNG files. Ensure that figures are fully defined and correct. For example, use \\begin{tikzpicture}...\\end{tikzpicture} to create figures. "
    r"Use \\begin{figure}[h]...\\end{figure} to include figures with captions, ensuring that each figure environment is properly closed and includes a caption. "
    r"Ensure the LaTeX document compiles without errors by carefully closing all open environments and properly formatting the document. "
    r"Do not generate non-existent file references or incomplete LaTeX code. Ensure all figures and images are created using LaTeX code. "
    r"If you encounter complex diagrams or graphs, use the tikz package to replicate them within LaTeX as accurately as possible. "
    r"If you need to create graphs or plots, use the pgfplots package to ensure they are generated within LaTeX. "
    r"Figure Placement: Use `[h]` instead of `[H]` for figure placement to allow flexibility in positioning and avoid formatting issues."
    r"Proper Use of `align` Environment: Ensure that only mathematical expressions are wrapped within `align`. Do not use `align` for non-mathematical content."
    r"Proof Environment: Use `\\begin{proof}` and `\\end{proof}` for proofs instead of `\\qed`."
