## Overview

`azure-switchboard` is a asyncio-only Python 3 library that provides an intelligent client loadbalancer for Azure OpenAI. You instantiate the Switchboard client with a set of Azure deployments, and the client distributes your chat completion requests across the provided deployments using the [power of two random choices](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf) method based on utilization. In this sense, it serves as a lightweight service mesh between your application and Azure OpenAI. The basic idea is inspired by [ServiceRouter](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi23-saokar.pdf).

## Features

- **API Compatibility**: `Switchboard.create` is a transparent proxy for `OpenAI.chat.completions.create` and can be used as a drop-in replacement
- **Coordination-Free**: Pick-2 algorithm does not require coordination between client instances to achieve good load distribution characteristics
- **Utilization-Aware**: Tracks TPM/RPM usage per deployment for utilization-based loadbalancing
- **Batteries Included**:
    - **Session Affinity**: Provide a `session_id` to route requests in the same session to the same deployment, optimizing for prompt caching
    - **Automatic Failover**: Internally monitors deployment health and manages retries to fallback deployments automatically
- **Lightweight**: Only three runtime dependencies: `openai`, `tenacity`, `wrapt`

## Basic Usage

See `tools/readme_example.py` for a runnable example.

```python
