## About The Project

![EasyMinecraftServer's configure command being used to create a settings file in the users home directory](https://cdn.nucc.tr/assets/emc-demo.png)

This is a simple project that lets you create Minecraft Server with ease. This simple app just downloads a Server JAR for you and changes some settings so that your server is secure and fast by default. This utility does not have management abilities however that is somewhere on the backlog and is pretty far from being made.
