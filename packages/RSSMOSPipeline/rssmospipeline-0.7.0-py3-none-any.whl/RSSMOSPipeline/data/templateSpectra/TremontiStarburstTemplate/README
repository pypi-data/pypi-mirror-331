This directory contains the data products used in the paper "An Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Atlas of Local Starbursts and Star-Forming Galaxies: the Legacy
of FOS and GHRS" by C. A. Tremonti, C. Leitherer, T. M. Heckman, and D.
Calzetti.  (ApJ submitted, 2003)

fos_ghrs_composite.txt -- a text file containing the composite spectrum 
shown in Figure 1.  The spectra used in making the composite are in the 
"corrected" directory described below.
column 1: rest wavelength in Angstroms
column 2: average flux of the rectified corrected spectra 
column 3: median flux of the rectified corrected spectra 
In constructing the composite regions of geocoronal emission were masked in
the input spectra.  Note that the average spectrum contains some artifacts 
in the 1600 A region due to the fact that some of the input spectra are very
noisy in this region (where the FOS G130H and G190H gratings overlap.)


The subdirectory "observed" contains the reduced FOS and GHRS spectra.
The spectra have NOT been deredshifted or corrected for Milky Way
reddening and absorption.  The files are in text format:
column 1: observed wavelength in Angstroms
column 2: observed flux in erg/s/cm^2/Angstrom
column 3: rectified observed flux

The subdirectory "corrected" contains spectra which have been de-redshifted,
corrected for Milky Way extinction, and corrected for the Milky Way ISM
absorption lines.  No correction has been made for geocoronal emission or
for extinction internal to the star forming region.
The files are in text format:
column 1: restframe wavelength in Angstroms
column 2: corrected flux in ergs/s/cm^2/Angstrom
column 3: rectified corrected flux
