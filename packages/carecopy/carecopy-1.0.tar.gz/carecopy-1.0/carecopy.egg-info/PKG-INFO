## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EasyCam/CareCopy.git
cd CareCopy
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m carecopy
```

### Pip Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install PySide6
pip install carecopy

# Run the application
python -m carecopy
```

## Usage

1. **Select Source**: Choose a file or directory to copy
2. **Select Destination**: Choose where to copy the file(s)
3. **Configure Options**:
   - Continue on error: Continue copying if individual files fail
   - Verify copied files: Ensure file integrity after copy
4. **Execute Operation**:
   - Copy: Start copying files
   - Compare: Compare source and destination
   - Estimate: Calculate size and estimated time
   - Cancel: Stop current operation

## How It Works

CareCopy uses multithreaded operations to ensure the UI stays responsive during file operations. The application includes:

- `CopyWorker`: Handles file copying with optional verification
- `CompareWorker`: Performs detailed comparison between files/directories
- `EstimateWorker`: Calculates file sizes and estimated copy times
