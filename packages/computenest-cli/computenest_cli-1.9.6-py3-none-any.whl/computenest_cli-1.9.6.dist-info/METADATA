# ComputeNest-CLI

`computenest-cli` is a command-line tool that integrates the creation, updating, and deployment of artifacts, as well as
the creation and updating of services within the ComputeNest framework. It allows users to manage their services,
construct artifacts, and handle custom operations, such as custom image creation.

Documentation for operations can be found in the Project Links or [computenest-cli-docs](https://github.com/aliyun-computenest/computenest-cli-docs).
