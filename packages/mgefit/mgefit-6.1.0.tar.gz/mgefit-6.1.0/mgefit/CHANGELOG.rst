V6.1.0: MC, Oxford, 03 March 2025
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduced a new, convenient single-line import: ``import mgefit as mge``.  
  Previous imports such as:  

  .. code-block:: python  

    from mgefit.find_galaxy import find_galaxy  
    from mgefit.mge_fit_1d import mge_fit_1d  
    from mgefit.mge_fit_sectors import mge_fit_sectors  

    f = find_galaxy(...)  
    m = mge_fit_1d(...)  
    m = mge_fit_sectors(...)  

  Can now be simplified as:  

  .. code-block:: python  

    import mgefit as mge  

    f = mge.find_galaxy(...)  
    m = mge.fit_1d(...)  
    m = mge.fit_sectors(...)  

- ``mge_fit_sectors``: Resolved a bug in the docstring usage example.  
- ``mge_fit_sectors``: Added validation to ensure ``sigmapsf`` matches the size
  of ``normpsf`` when it is provided as a scalar.  
- ``find_galaxy``: Incorporated the pixel indices ``.ind`` of the selected
  region into the output class attributes.  
- ``mge_fit_1d``: Expanded the docstring with additional details, based on
  feedback from Eduardo Vitral (roe.ac.uk).  
- ``mge_fit_1d``: Fixed an issue causing the program to stop when
  ``linear=True`` and ``quiet=False``.  

V6.0.4: MC, Oxford, 3 September 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- 25th anniversary edition :-)
- Replaced the ``mpfit`` non-linear least-squares optimization procedure with
  the more robust ``capfit.capfit`` from Cappellari (2023).
- Eliminated dependency on ``scipy.optimize.nnls`` after the original F77 code
  by Lawson & Hanson was replaced in SciPy v1.12 by an unreliable new function
  which broke my code. Now use my faster and robust ``capfit.lsq_box`` instead.
- ``mge_fit_1d``: New keyword ``linear`` to skip the nonlinear fit and optimize
  only the weights at fixed MGE sigma.
- ``find_galaxy``: replaced ``signal.medfilt`` with ``ndimage.median_filter``
  to avoid a bug introduced in SciPy v1.14.
- ``mge_print_contours``: New keyword ``magstep`` to control the step of the 
  contour levels in magnitudes.

V5.0.15: MC, Oxford, 31 March 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``mge_print_contours``, ``mge_print_contours_twist``: New keyword `minlevel`.

  the central pixel.

V5.0.13: MC, Oxford, 1 October 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- With ``negative=True`` use NumPy ``linalg.lstsq`` instead of SciPy
  for a better default in the criterion for rank deficiency.
  Fixed ignoring negative weights in output with ``negative=True``.  

V5.0.12: MC, Oxford, 1 October 2018
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed clock ``DeprecationWarning`` in Python 3.7.

V4.1.0: MC, Oxford, 22 April 2010
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Allow QBOUNDS to have four elements, to perform bulge/disk
  decompositions similarly to the /BULGE_DISK option.

  decompositions using MGE. Updated MPFIT to version v1.52 2008/05/04,
  to fix a bug with the required parinfo.tied mechanism. In the new
  version of MPFIT, which I again renamed MGE_MPFIT, I implemented
  my previous important modification to improve convergence with
  MGE_FIT_SECTORS. 

V3.9.5: MC, Oxford, 24 September 2008
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Force Gaussians smaller than the PSF, which have a degenerate

  the /LINEAR implementation. It's almost always redundant, but quick.  

V3.8.1: MC, Vicenza, 23 August 2004
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Make sure this routine uses the Nov/2000 version of Craig Markwardt
  MPFIT which was renamed MGE_MPFIT to prevent potential conflicts with
  more recent versions of the same routine.
