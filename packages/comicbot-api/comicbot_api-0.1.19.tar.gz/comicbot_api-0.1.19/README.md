## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or above
- Virtualenv 20.14.1 or above

# Project Expectations
- Client library to get new releases, or releases for a given date. 
- Client can filter by the format of releases e.g. 'single-issue' or by publisher e.g. 'marvel'
- Client should be straight forward and easy to use by using the KISS model (Keep It Simple Stupid)
- Cache results where possible as not to hit provider with too many requests for the same data

## How to get started
### Create a virtual environment
```bash
virtualenv -p python3.9 venv
```

### Enter virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Poetry, the package manager for this project
```bash
pip install poetry
```

### Build distribution of project
```bash
poetry build
```
Build artifacts will be located in `dist/`
### Running Unit Tests
#### Pytest to run all unit tests in `test/`
```bash
pytest
```

### Pytest to run all unit tests and lint code with `Pylama`
```bash
pytest --pylama
```

### Linting
This project strives to keep the code style in line with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
To test the project for compliance with PEP8, I use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)
```bash
ruff check
```

### Deployment
Github actions auto creates and pushes releases to PyPi on creating a tag/release.
#### Manual
To deploy, one must obtain an API key from the public pypi (https://pypi.org/project/comicbot-api/)
and add it to the local `poetry` configuration with the following command:
```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <pypi-token>
```
Once we have a valid token, we can push distributions to PyPi. 
```bash
poetry build
poertry publish
```
or do both with
```bash
poetry publish --build
```
