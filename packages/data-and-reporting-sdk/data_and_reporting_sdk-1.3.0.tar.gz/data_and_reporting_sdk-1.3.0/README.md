
# Getting Started with Shell Data & Reporting APIs

## Introduction

Data And Reporting product consists of API's which provides details of transaction and invoice informations about shell cards.
The Shell Card Transaction and Invoice API is REST-based and employs Basic authentication in Version 1 and Oauth authentication in Version 2 end points. The API endpoints accept JSON-encoded request bodies, return JSON-encoded responses and use standard HTTP response codes.
All resources are located in the Shell Card Platform.  The Shell Card Platform is the overall platform that encompasses all the internal Shell systems used to manage resources.
All endpoints use the `POST` verb for retrieving, updating, creating and deleting resources in the Shell Card Platform. The endpoints that retrieve resources from the Shell Card Platform allow flexible search parameters in the API request body.

## Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `3.7+`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install data-and-reporting-sdk==1.3.0
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/data-and-reporting-sdk/1.3.0

## Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `pytest` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands

```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](https://www.github.com/sdks-io/data-and-reporting-python-sdk/tree/1.3.0/doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | `Environment` | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.SIT`** |
| `http_client_instance` | `HttpClient` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| `override_http_client_configuration` | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| `http_call_back` | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| `backoff_factor` | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| `retry_statuses` | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| `retry_methods` | `Array of string` | The http methods on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: ['GET', 'PUT']** |
| `basic_auth_credentials` | [`BasicAuthCredentials`](https://www.github.com/sdks-io/data-and-reporting-python-sdk/tree/1.3.0/doc/auth/basic-authentication.md) | The credential object for Basic Authentication |
| `bearer_token_credentials` | [`BearerTokenCredentials`](https://www.github.com/sdks-io/data-and-reporting-python-sdk/tree/1.3.0/doc/auth/oauth-2-client-credentials-grant.md) | The credential object for OAuth 2 Client Credentials Grant |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
client = ShelldatareportingapisClient(
    basic_auth_credentials=BasicAuthCredentials(
        username='Username',
        password='Password'
    ),
    bearer_token_credentials=BearerTokenCredentials(
        o_auth_client_id='OAuthClientId',
        o_auth_client_secret='OAuthClientSecret'
    ),
    environment=Environment.SIT
)
```

## Environments

The SDK can be configured to use a different environment for making API calls. Available environments are:

### Fields

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| SIT | **Default** |
| Production | - |

## Authorization

This API uses the following authentication schemes.
