# LOBSTER

The **L**ightweight **O**pen **B**MW **S**oftware **T**raceability
**E**vidence **R**eport allows you to demonstrate software traceability
and requirements coverage, which is essential for meeting standards
such as ISO 26262.

This package contains a tool to extract tracing tags from Python3 source
code.

## Tools

* `lobster-python`: Extract requirements from Python3 code

## Usage

This tool supports both Python code and PyUnit/unittest unit tests.

For either code or tests you can embedd tracing tags like this:

```python
   def potato(self):
      # lobster-trace: something.example
      return "potato"
```

You can add justifications as well:

```python
   def potato(self):
      # lobster-exclude: a very good reason is here
      return "potato"
```

For classes, you have a choice on how you trace them: you either
annotate the class itself, or each individual method. If you choose to
annotate the class itself, then you will get warnings for each method
with an annotation.

For normal code the usage is:

```bash
lobster-python FILES_OR_DIRS
```

Note that `FILES_OR_DIRS` should not contain any tests.
They will be treated as regular code otherwise.

For tests (`pyunit` or `unittest`) the usage is:

```bash
lobster-python --activity FILES_OR_DIRS
```

Here `FILES_OR_DIRS` may contain additional code (like the implementation of mock classes), but it will be ignored.

For `pyunit` and `unittest` the tool automatically ignores any class function that is
not explicitly a test (i.e. you don't need to manually exclude your
setup or tear down code, only individual tests will be included).

Please note that the generated output json files always use `PyTest` as framework indicator, even if `unittest` is used:
```json
{
  "framework": "PyUnit",
  "kind": "Test"
}
```

## Known Issues

The resulting lobster file does not use the method names, but instead uses the class name together with an integer counter for consecutive methods.
This only affects methods in a class.
It does not affect functions.
For details see [issue 89](https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/lobster/issues/89).
It will be fixed with the next release.
