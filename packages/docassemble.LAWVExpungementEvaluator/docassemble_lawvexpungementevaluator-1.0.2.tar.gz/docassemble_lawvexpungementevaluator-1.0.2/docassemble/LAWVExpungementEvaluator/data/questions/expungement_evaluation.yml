question: |
  Welcome to Legal Aid of West Virginia's Expungement Tool
subquestion: |
  You had an issue with the criminal system. You have something on your criminal record. It 
  is causing problems for you. If you meet certain requirements, you may be able to get your 
  criminal record sealed through a process called expungement. 

  This is a free online tool which can help you find out whether you may be eligible to 
  expunge your criminal record.  The tool also suggests next steps which often means working
  with a lawyer.
  
  ### Before you start
  * Our eligibility tool can only help with expungement of *West Virginia* criminal
  records, **not out-of-state or federal records**.
  * Before beginning to answer these questions, you will need information about your
  record, like the name of the offense(s) you were **charged** with, the name of the offense(s)
  you were **{convicted}** of, the **{disposition}** of your case(s), and when your incaceration,
  probation, or parole **ended**.  You need to provide accurate information.  If the information
  you provide is not accurate, the results of the tool will not be correct.
      * [West Virginia Magistrate Court Lookup](https://mcrsearch.courtswv.gov/)
      * [West Virginia State Police Background Check Information](https://www.wvsp.gov/Criminal%20Records/Pages/default.aspx)
  * If you decide to apply for expungement after answering these questions, a judge in the
  county where you were convicted will decide whether to approve your request.  This site will
  tell you if you *may* be eligible for expungement.  **Only a judge** can decide whether or not
  to grant your request.
  
  Once you are ready, you can click on the button below to answer some questions about your record. When you are finished, we
  will let you know if you may be eligible for expungement and what you can do next.

question: |
  It appears you *may* be eligible for an expungement.
subquestion: |  
  We **strongly** recommend contacting Legal Aid of West Virginia or an attorney for help.
  
  Under West Virginia law, you are only permitted to file for only **one** expungement. Therefore, 
  it is important to be certain that you include ALL convictions and charges and that it is 
  the right time to file. You will not get a second chance at expungement.
