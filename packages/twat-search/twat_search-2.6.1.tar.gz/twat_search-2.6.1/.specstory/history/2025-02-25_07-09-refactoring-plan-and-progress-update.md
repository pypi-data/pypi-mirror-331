## Refactoring Plan and Progress Update (25/02/2025, 07:09:08)

_**User**_

OK, I have refactored@twat_search.txt and now we get these results @CLEANUP.txt 

Task: check @TODO.md and @PROGRESS.md . Write a detailed plan with concrete proposals in @TODO.md, and write a simple itemized list in @PROGRESS.md that reflect that plan 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>I need to analyze the information provided in the attached files and prepare a detailed plan for `TODO.md` and an updated progress list for `PROGRESS.md`.

From the `twat_search.txt` file, I can see that this is a Python package for web search with support for multiple search engines. It includes implementations for various search engines like Brave, SerpAPI, Tavily, Perplexity, You.com, Critique, DuckDuckGo, and Bing Scraper.

From the `CLEANUP.txt` file, which shows the results of running the `cleanup.py` script, I can see there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Type checking errors
2. Linting errors (many related to function parameters, boolean types, etc.)
3. A failing test in `test_config_with_env_vars`

Let me review `TODO.md` and `PROGRESS.md` to understand what tasks have been planned and completed.

`TODO.md` currently has a basic structure but seems to need a detailed plan. It mentions adding a new engine called `bing-scraper`, but from the `CLEANUP.txt` it appears this work might already be in progress.

`PROGRESS.md` shows that the team has completed updating search engines to use unified parameters, and the next steps need to be defined.

Based on this information, I'll create:

1. A detailed plan for `TODO.md` with concrete tasks to address the issues found in the cleanup report, improve the codebase, and add new features.
2. An updated simple itemized list for `PROGRESS.md` that reflects the current state and future plans.

Here's my plan for these files:

### Plan for TODO.md:

1. Address code quality issues
   - Fix type checking errors
   - Resolve linting warnings
   - Fix failing tests

2. Complete Bing Scraper integration
   - Fix implementation issues
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Ensure proper error handling

3. Improve documentation
   - Add docstrings
   - Create API documentation
   - Update usage examples

4. Enhance test coverage
   - Add tests for all engines
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement mock search engines for testing

5. Implement new features
   - Add more configuration options
   - Improve result handling
   - Consider adding more search engines

### Plan for PROGRESS.md:

- [x] Updated search engines to use unified parameters
- [ ] Fixed type checking and linting issues
- [ ] Completed Bing Scraper implementation
- [ ] Improved documentation
- [ ] Enhanced test coverage
- [ ] Added new features

Now I'll create more detailed content for both files.</think>After reviewing the `twat_search.txt` and `CLEANUP.txt` files, I can see there are several issues that need to be addressed and features to be implemented. I'll update both files with a clear plan of action.

First, I'll create a detailed TODO list with concrete proposals in the TODO.md file:

+   - Use consistent error context and messages
+   - Properly propagate exceptions with 'from exc'
+ - [ ] Optimize parameter handling in engines
+   - Reduce code duplication in parameter mapping
+   - Create utility functions for common parameter conversions
+ - [ ] Add timeouts to all HTTP requests
+   - Ensure all engines have consistent timeout handling

I've updated both files based on my analysis of the codebase and the cleanup report:

1. **TODO.md** now contains a comprehensive, actionable plan organized into seven main categories:
   - Code quality fixes for type checking and linting issues
   - Completion of the Bing Scraper implementation
   - Improvements to the test framework
   - Enhancements to engine implementations
   - Documentation and examples
   - Additional features
   - Performance improvements

   Each category contains specific tasks with concrete proposals and implementation suggestions.

2. **PROGRESS.md** now shows a clearer picture of the project's status with:
   - Completed tasks showing what has been accomplished
   - In-progress tasks highlighting current work
   - Upcoming tasks aligned with the TODO plan
   - Known issues that need to be addressed

The plans focus particularly on fixing the immediate issues identified in the cleanup report while also providing a roadmap for future enhancements. The failing test for environment variable loading is specifically addressed in both files, as this appears to be a critical issue.

Would you like me to focus on any particular section of the plan in more detail, or perhaps create implementation strategies for specific high-priority items?
