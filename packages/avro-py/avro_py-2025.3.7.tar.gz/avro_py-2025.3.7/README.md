## ‚ö° Overview

**avro.py** provides a fully fledged, batteries-included text parser which can
parse, reverse and even convert English Roman script into its phonetic
equivalent (unicode) of Bengali. At its core, it implements an extensively
modified version of the **Avro Phonetic Dictionary Search Library** by [Mehdi
Hasan Khan](https://github.com/mugli).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Update: As of October 2024, Python 3.8 has reached its EOL, so for keeping
> this project updated, the minimum required version will be Python 3.9 from now
> onwards. It is strongly suggested that you migrate your project for better
> compatibility. <br>

## ‚ú® Inspirations

This package is inspired from Rifat Nabi's jsAvroPhonetic library and derives from Kaustav Das Modak's pyAvroPhonetic.

<br>

## üî® Installation

This package requires **Python 3.9 or higher** to be used inside your development environment.

```sh
# Install / upgrade.
$ pip install avro.py
```

#### üì¶ ...or you can try the CLI!

[**avnie**](https://github.com/hitblast/avnie) is a newly developed CLI tool
that uses avro.py under the hood. You can install it using:

```sh
# Install / upgrade avnie.
$ pip install avnie
```

<br>

## üîñ Usage Guide

This small tour guide will describe how you can use avro.py back and forth to
operate (cutlery!) on Bengali text. You can also check the
[examples](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/tree/main/examples) directory for
checking [this whole
snippet](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/blob/main/examples/simple.py) in
action, as well as other use cases.

1. `parse()`

Let's assume I want to parse some English text to Bengali, which is "ami banglay
gan gai.", so in this case to convert it to Bengali, we can use this snippet as
a starter code and then extend upon it as our boilerplate for multiple
operations later on:

```python
# Import the package.
import avro

# Our dummy text.
dummy = 'ami banglay gan gai.'

# Parsing the text.
avro_output = avro.parse(dummy)
print(output)  # Output: ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶á‡•§
```

2. `parse(bijoy=True)`

Alternatively, I can also do it in Bijoy Keyboard format:

```python
bijoy_output = avro.parse(dummy, bijoy=True)
# Output: Avwg evsjvh‡¶º Mvb MvB‡•§
```

3. `to_bijoy()`

Or, we can take the previous `avro_output` and convert it to Bijoy if we want to, like this:

```python
bijoy_text = avro.to_bijoy(avro_output)
# Output: Avwg evsjvh‡¶º Mvb MvB‡•§
```

4. `to_unicode()`

Conversely, we can convert the Bijoy text we got just now and convert it back to Unicode Bengali:

```python
unicode_text = avro.to_unicode(bijoy_text)
# Output: ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶á‡•§
```

5. `reverse()`

Finally, we can just reverse back to the original text we passed as input in the first place:

```python
reversed_text = avro.reverse(uncode_text)
# Output: ami banglay gan gai.
```

### üêç A note on `async`/`await` support:

Since version
[2024.12.5](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/releases/tag/2024.12.5), the
package now supports `async`/`await` syntax for all the functions.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless you have a very specific use, the asynchronous functions only
> provide slight performance improvements and are not necessary for most use
> cases, so their usage is optional.

Please have a look at the
[examples](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/tree/main/examples) for a more
thorough understanding of how to use the package in both synchronous and
asynchronous contexts.

**Additional Developer Notes**

This project is based on the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package
manager by Astral. In order to automatically update and set up the environment,
you can run the following command:

```sh
# (Optional) Install recommended Python version: (also sets up the virtual environment)
$ uv python install && uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the project:
$ uv sync --all-extras --dev

# Build the project:
$ uv build --verbose
```

In order to run the tests, you can use the following command:

```sh
# Run unit tests:
$ uv run pytest .
```


<br>

### üêõ We're looking for bug hunters, by the way!

If you come across any kind of bug or wanna request a feature, please let us
know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/issues). We
do need more ideas to keep the project alive and running, don't we? :P
