It is possible to use Chessidle with [python-chess][python-chess-link]. Here is a small example script to play against Chessidle in the terminal.

```python
import chess
import chess.engine

board = chess.Board()
engine = chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci('chessidle')

while not board.is_game_over():
    print(board, '\n')

    s = input('Your move:') if board.turn else engine.play(board, chess.engine.Limit(time=3)).move.uci()
    
    for push in (board.push_uci, board.push_san):
        try:
            push(s)
            print(s, 'played \n')
            break
        except ValueError:
            pass
    else:
        print('Invalid move \n')

print(board, '\n\n', 'Game is over')
engine.quit()
```
