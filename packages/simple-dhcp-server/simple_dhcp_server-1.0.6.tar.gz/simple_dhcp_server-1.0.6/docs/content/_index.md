## Compatibility

It was testet under Ubuntu 14 and later with Python and Windows 7 and later.
It does not use any operating system specific Python functions, so it should work when Python 3 works.

## Features

This DHCP server program will assign IP addresses ten seconds later than requested. So, it can be used in networks that already have a DHCP server running.

This Simple DHCP server

- shows clients in the network
- lists IP address, MAC address and host name
- highlights recently refreshed/added clients
- assigns IP addresses 10 seconds later than usual DHCP servers
- remembers addresses in the `hosts.csv` file
- can be configured to serve all DHCP options using Python/Yaml
