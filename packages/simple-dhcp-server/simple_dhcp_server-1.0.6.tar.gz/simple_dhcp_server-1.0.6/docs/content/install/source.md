You can install the source files directly. There are many ways to do that.

## PyPI

If you have installed [Python], you can run `pip` to install the package from [PyPI].

### QT Frontend

```sh
pip install simple-dhcp-server[qt]
```

### Tk Frontend

If you cannot install QT, you can use the Tk version:

```sh
pip install simple-dhcp-server
```

### GitHub

If you have installed [Python], you can run `pip` to install the package from [GitHub] directly.

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/niccokunzmann/simple_dhcp_server.git
```

## Pipx

[pipx] makes installation even nicer because it isolates the app.

1. Install [pipx]
2. Install and start the Simple DHCP Server:

    ```sh
    sudo pipx run --spec simple-dhcp-server[qt] simple-dhcp-server-qt  
    ```

## Development Setup

You can also [setup the Simple DHCP Server for development][4].
