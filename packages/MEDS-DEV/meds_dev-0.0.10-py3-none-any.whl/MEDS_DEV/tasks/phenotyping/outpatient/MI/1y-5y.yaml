    This file defines a prediction task that predicts, for patients who will both (a) not have a MI within 1
    year of their annual physical and (b) have some data available at least 5 years after their annual physical,
    whether they will have a MI between 1 and 5 years after their annual physical. Note that these criteria
    induce censoring impacts on the included distribution which must be accounted for before this task could be
    deployed.

predicates:
  MI: ???
  annual_physical: ???

trigger: annual_physical
