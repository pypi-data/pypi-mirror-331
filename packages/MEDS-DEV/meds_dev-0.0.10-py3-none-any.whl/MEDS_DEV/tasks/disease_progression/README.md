# Disease Progression

This folder contains tasks for predicting disease progression in patients. This task is vital for monitoring
patient health and planning appropriate interventions. Patterns can be identified to indicate how likely a
disease is to evolve and to what stage. Accurate predictions enable healthcare providers to tailor treatment
plans, anticipate complications, and make informed decisions about patient care.
