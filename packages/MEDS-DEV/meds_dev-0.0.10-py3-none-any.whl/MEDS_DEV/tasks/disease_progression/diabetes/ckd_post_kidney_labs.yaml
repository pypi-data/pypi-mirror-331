description: >-
  This task predicts the onset of new CKD in diabetic patients within 5 years of any laboratory test they
  obtain that includes a kidney panel. Patient events are only eligible if those patients have (a) a standing
  diabetes diagnosis, (b) no prior CKD diagnosis, (c) at least one data point more than 5 years after the
  event, and (d) no events within 90 days prior to the event in which kidney panels will have been measured.
