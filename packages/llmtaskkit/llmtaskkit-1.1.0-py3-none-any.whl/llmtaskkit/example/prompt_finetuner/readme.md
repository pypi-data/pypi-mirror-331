# Prompt Fine-Tuner

Prompt Fine-Tuner is a Python project designed to elevate the effectiveness of prompts by guiding users through a structured, multi-step refinement process. By interacting with users to clarify objectives and gather key context, the tool iteratively transforms basic prompt drafts into highly optimized final prompts.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Enhance the clarity, precision, and impact of prompts for large language models.
- **Functionality:** The project engages users with targeted questions, generates multiple draft versions, evaluates each iteration based on defined criteria, and refines the prompt to its optimal formâ€”all through a seamless, interactive workflow.

## Impact on Prompt Quality

By systematically refining prompt drafts, Prompt Fine-Tuner:
- Eliminates ambiguity by asking clarifying questions.
- Offers diverse perspectives through multiple draft options.
- Incorporates detailed evaluations and feedback for continuous improvement.
- Produces final prompts that are coherent, actionable, and tailored to the intended use case.

This approach not only improves prompt quality but also enhances overall interaction with AI models, ensuring outputs that are both relevant and robust.
