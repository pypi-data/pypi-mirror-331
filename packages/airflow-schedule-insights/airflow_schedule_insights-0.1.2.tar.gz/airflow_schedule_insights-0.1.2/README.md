# Airflow Schedule Insights Plugin

The Airflow Schedule Insights Plugin for [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) allows you to visualize DAG runs in a Gantt chart, predict future runs, and identify DAGs that won't run, providing a seamless and efficient workflow for managing your pipelines. Enhance your workflow monitoring and planning with intuitive visualizations.

2. View all DAG runs in a Gantt chart:

   ![Gantt Chart Logs](https://github.com/hipposys-ltd/airflow-schedule-insights/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha.0/gantt_chart_history_logs.png)

3. Toggle the `Show Future Runs?` option to predict the next runs for your DAGs and generate a list of all the DAGs that won't run.

   **Note**: All event-driven DAGs (scheduled by datasets and triggers) are predicted only to their next run.

4. Future DAGs will be highlighted in gray on the Gantt chart:

5. A table of future runs will be displayed, with events ordered by their start date:

6. Below this, you will find a table listing all the DAGs that won't run:
