        Generate a probability density function (PDF) based on the specified method and input data.

        This method supports two types of PDF estimation:
        1. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Uses a non-parametric approach to estimate the PDF based on the provided data.
        2. **Gaussian Distribution**: Assumes a Gaussian (normal) distribution, where the mean and standard deviation can be either provided or estimated from the data.

        Parameters:
            data (np.ndarray): A 1D array of numerical data points used to estimate the PDF.
            pdf_type (str, optional): The method used for PDF estimation. 
                - `'kde'` for Kernel Density Estimation (default).
                - `'gaussian'` for Gaussian distribution.

            sigma (float, optional): The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. This is required if `pdf_type` is `'gaussian'`.

        Notes:
            - If `pdf_type` is `'kde'`, the method uses the `pdf_from_kde` function to estimate the PDF.
            - If `pdf_type` is `'gaussian'`, the method uses the specified or computed mean (`mu`) and standard deviation (`sigma`) to define a Gaussian PDF.

            pdf_1 (callable): A function representing the first probability density function (PDF).
            pdf_2 (callable): A function representing the second probability density function (PDF).
            integral (float): The integral of the overlap between the two distributions, representing the area 
                            of their intersection.
            error (float): The error value associated with the overlap integral, which quantifies the accuracy 
                        or uncertainty of the overlap calculation.
            x_range (tuple, optional): The range of x-values over which the distributions will be evaluated 
                                        and plotted. Defaults to (-10, 10).

        Notes:
            - The plot will include:
                - A blue line for the first PDF (`pdf_1`),
                - An orange line for the second PDF (`pdf_2`),
