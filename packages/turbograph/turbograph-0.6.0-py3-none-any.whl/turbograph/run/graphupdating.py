    """Rebuild an existing dependency graph with new functions, values, or vertices.

    This function allows modifying a computation graph by:

    - Retaining only a subset of vertices.
    - Updating functions assigned to vertices.
    - Assigning or overriding precomputed values.
    - Setting a new function call mode.
    - Reducing the graph by treating known values as constants.

    Args:
        graph: The dependency graph to update.

        vertices: The set of vertices to retain. If specified, only these vertices
            and their ancestors are kept.

        values: A mapping from vertex names to precomputed values. If provided,
            these values override the existing ones in the graph.

        funcs: A mapping from vertex names to updated functions. If provided,
            these functions override the existing ones in the graph.

        reduce: If ``True``, removes inbound edges for vertices with known values.
            This treats these vertices as constants and prevents unnecessary
            recomputation.

        call_mode: The mode used to pass inputs to functions.
            If ``None``, the call mode remains unchanged.

            - ``"args"`` (default): Dependencies are passed as positional arguments.
            - ``"kwargs"``: Dependencies are passed as keyword arguments.
            - ``"arg"``: Dependencies are passed as a single dictionary.

        reduce: If ``True``, removes inbound edges for vertices with known values,
            treating them as constants.
            This ensures that these vertices no longer depend on their predecessors,
            preventing unnecessary computations

    Returns:
        The updated graph object with the modified functions, values, and vertices.

    Example:
        Update a graph with new functions and values.

        >>> from turbograph import rebuild_graph, compute_from_graph, build_graph
        >>> graph = build_graph(
        ...     {"sum": ["a", "b"]},
        ...     funcs={"sum": lambda a, b: a + b},
        ...     values={"a": 1, "b": 2},
        ... )
        >>> compute_from_graph(graph)  # 1 + 2 = 3
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'sum': 3}
        >>> updated_graph = rebuild_graph(
        ...     graph, funcs={"sum": lambda a, b: a * b}, values={"a": 10}
        ... )
        >>> compute_from_graph(updated_graph)  # 10 * 2 = 20
        {'a': 10, 'b': 2, 'sum': 20}

        Reduce the graph to retain only `"b"` and its dependencies.

        >>> graph = build_graph(
        ...     {"b": ["a"], "c": ["b"]},
        ...     funcs={"b": lambda x: x + 1, "c": lambda x: x + 2},
        ...     values={"a": 1},
        ... )
        >>> smaller_graph = rebuild_graph(graph, vertices=["b"])
        >>> compute_from_graph(smaller_graph)
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

    Notes:
        - If both a function update and a precomputed value are provided for a vertex,
          the precomputed value takes precedence.
        - If `vertices` is specified, computations are limited to those vertices
          and their ancestors.
        - If `reduce` is enabled, vertices with known values will not be recomputed.
