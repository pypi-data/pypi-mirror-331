    r"""Build a validated directed acyclic graph (DAG) from raw vertex specifications.

    This function processes raw vertex specifications to construct a dependency graph.
    Each vertex represents a quantity, and directed edges indicate dependencies.
    The graph is validated to ensure it is acyclic.

    Args:
        raw_specifications: A mapping of vertex names to their specifications, defining
            how each vertex is computed and its dependencies.
            Specifications can take one of four forms:

            - **Function:**
              The function's signature determines dependencies:

                - If ``call_mode='args'``, positional arguments are considered
                  predecessors.
                - If ``call_mode='kwargs'``, keyword arguments are considered
                  predecessors.

            - **Value:** A non-callable value for the vertex.

            - **Dictionary:**
                - ``func`` is an optional function computing the vertex
                  (default: ``None``).
                - ``predecessors`` is an optional list of dependency names
                  (default: ``()``).
                - ``value`` is an optional precomputed value
                  (default: :py:data:`turbograph.NA`).

            - **Sequence:**: A tuple of up to three elements
              ``(func, predecessors, value)``.

        vertices: An optional subset of vertices to include in the graph.
            If ``None``, all vertices in ``raw_specifications`` are included.
            Otherwise, only the specified vertices and their ancestors are retained.

        call_mode: The mode used for passing input values to functions, stored
            as a graph attribute:

            - ``"args"`` (default): Inputs are passed as positional arguments.
            - ``"kwargs"``: Inputs are passed as keyword arguments.
            - ``"arg"``: Inputs are passed as a single dictionary argument.

        backend: The graph backend to use. If ``None``, the first available backend is
            used.

    Returns:
        A ``GraphWrapper`` object representing the constructed dependency graph.

        The graph contains:

        - Vertices with attributes:
            - ``"func"``: Function computing the vertex (or ``None`` if absent).
            - ``"value"``: Precomputed value, or a default placeholder
              :py:data:`turbograph.NA` if absent.
            - ``"predecessors"``: Ordered list of predecessor vertices.

        - Directed edges representing dependencies.
        - The ``call_mode`` stored as a graph attribute.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the specified dependencies create a cyclic graph.
        ValueError: If the graph contains isolated vertices.

    Example:
        Construct a simple graph computing ``a - b``:

        >>> graph = build_graph({"sub": lambda a, b: a - b})
        >>> compute_from_graph(graph, values={"a": 5, "b": 3}, vertices=["sub"])
        {'sub': 2}

        Construct a graph with precomputed values:

        >>> graph = build_graph(
        ...     {"a": 10, "b": 5, "sub": lambda a, b: a - b},
        ...     vertices=["sub"]
        ... )
        >>> compute_from_graph(graph)
        {'a': 10, 'b': 5, 'sub': 5}
