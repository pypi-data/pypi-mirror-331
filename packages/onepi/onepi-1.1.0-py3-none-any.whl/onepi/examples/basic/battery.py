Description:
Reads the battery voltage and prints its value on the LCD and Serial Monitor.
Also configures the minimum battery voltage that causes the robot to
stop if voltage is below the defined value.
It is VERY important that you define this minimum voltage correctly
to preserve your robot's battery life.
