Description:
Robot moves avoiding obstacles. Wheel speeds are set depending on the sensor readings.
e.g. If the left sensor reports a value higher than the right sensor, then the speed of
the oposite wheel (right wheel in this case) will be reduced by an amount proportional
to that sensor reading (multiplied by a constant gain kL)
