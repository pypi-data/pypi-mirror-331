Description:
Read obstacle sensors range distance for left and right IR sensors.
Range varies from 0 to 20:
 -> 0 means no obstacle is detected
 -> 20 means obstacle is very close to the sensor
The robot has new readings every 25ms (40 readings per second)
Note: Valid for TSSP4056 IR sensors shipped with robots from 2023.
