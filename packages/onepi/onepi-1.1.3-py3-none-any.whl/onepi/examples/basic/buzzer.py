 Latest update: 08-09-2023

 This code example is in the public domain.
 http://www.botnroll.com

This example works better by using a software pwm instead of using
the hardware pwm pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Note that the connection to the Bot'n Roll should be on pin 9 (where the buzzer is attached to).
