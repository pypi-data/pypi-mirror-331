IMPORTANT!!!!
Before you use this example you MUST calibrate the line sensor.
Run line_sensor_calibration.py (in calibration folder) first!

Line reading returns a value between -100 to 100 where:
  * 0 (zero) corresponds to the line being centred
  * -100 (negative 100) when the line is at the far left side
  * +100 (positive 100) when the line is at the far right side
