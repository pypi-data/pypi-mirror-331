Description:
This example implements a finite state machine (FSM)
Each state corresponds to a different task the robot has to execute
If statements are used to evaluate condition that can trigger transitions
between states, meaning changing the task it has to perform.
e.g. if the robot is attacking (moving forward) and detects an obstacle it then
changes the state to retreat (start moving backwards)
