Description:
Infra-Red obstacle detection LEDs (IRE1 and IRE2) are switched ON and OFF
every second in this example code.
For Race of Champions start, IR LEDs must be OFF.
Messages are printed on the LCD and terminal accordingly.
WARNING!!!
Infra-Red light can damage your eyes if you look to emitting IR LED's.
You will not be able to see the LED's emitting light because human eyes
cannot see infra-red light.
You can see the IR LED's light using a camera (from you cell phone or
smart-phone, for example).
Placing an obstacle 2cm in front of the LEDS should switch IRS1 and IRS2 ON.
