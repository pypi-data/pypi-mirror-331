# numba-scfg

Numba compatible SCFG (Structured Control Flow Graph)  utilities.

## About

This repository contains Numba compatible utilities for working with SCFG
(Structured Control FLow Graphs). SCFGs are a type of Intermediary
Representation (IR) suitable for regularizing Python source and bytecode.

The code in this repository is an implementation of the CFG restructuring
algorithms in Bahmann 2015, specifically those from section 4.1 and 4.2: namely
"loop restructuring" and "branch restructuring". These are interesting for
Numba because they serve to clearly identify regions within the Python source
and bytecode.

Note: The project was previously known as `numba-rvsdg` and was renamed to
`numba-scfg` in early 2025. The original scope was to implement Regional Value
State Dependence Graphs (RVSDG), where SCFGs are necessary intermediary for the
transformation from Python to RVSDG. Over time, it became evident that the SCFG
transformations are important and reusable enough in their own right to warrant
their own package and so this package was renamed.


## Development

If you have `make` and `conda` available, a common setting up workflow could
be:

```
$ make conda-env                        # setup conda environment
$ conda activate numba-scfg             # activate it
$ make conda-install                    # install dependencies
$ make                                  # lint, build and test the project
```

Feel free to look at the
[`makefile`](https://github.com/numba/numba-rvsdg/blob/main/makefile) for all
development commands.
