    Smooth classifications at the image level for all results in the MD-formatted results

    This function generally expresses the notion that an image with 700 cows and one deer

    Only count detections with a classification confidence threshold above

    If an image has at least [options.min_detections_above_threshold] such detections

    in the second-most-common category, flip all detections to the most common
    category.

    Smooth classifications at the sequence level for all results in the MD-formatted results
    file [md_results_file], optionally writing a new set of results to [output_file].
    
    This function generally expresses the notion that a sequence that looks like
    deer/deer/deer/elk/deer/deer/deer/deer is really just a deer.
    
    Args:
        md_results (str or dict): MegaDetector-formatted classification results file to smooth
          (or already-loaded results).  If you supply a dict, it's modified in place by default, but
          a copy can be forced by setting options.modify_in_place=False.
        cct_sequence_information (str, dict, or list): COCO Camera Traps file containing sequence IDs for
          each image (or an already-loaded CCT-formatted dict, or just the 'images' list from a CCT dict).
        output_file (str, optional): .json file to write smoothed results
        options (ClassificationSmoothingOptionsSequenceLevel, optional): see 
          ClassificationSmoothingOptionsSequenceLevel for details.
            
    Returns:
        dict: MegaDetector-results-formatted dict, identical to what's written to
        [output_file] if [output_file] is not None.
