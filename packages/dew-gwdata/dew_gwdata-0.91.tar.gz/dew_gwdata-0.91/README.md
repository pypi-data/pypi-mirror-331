# dew_gwdata

Python module for accessing groundwater data internally at DEW

## Install

The source code is on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dewsurfacewater/dew_gwdata), while Python packages (source and binary) are published on
the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/dew-gwdata/) and 
on a dedicated channel on [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/dew-waterscience/repo).

### From PyPI (most recent release)

Run this in Command Prompt to install from PyPI:

```
pip install dew_gwdata
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```
pip install -U dew_gwdata
```

### From Anaconda 

You can also install using conda/mamba if you prefer:

```
mamba install -c dew-waterscience dew_gwdata
```

To upgrade:

```
mamba upgrade -c dew-waterscience dew_gwdata
```

The version may not be as up-to-date as the PyPI version.

### From Bitbucket

This is how you can install the latest version of the source code directly from Bitbucket (the version control repository):

```
python -m pip install git+https://kinveraritysagov@bitbucket.org/dewsurfacewater/dew_gwdata.git
```

You will need to replace ``kinveraritysagov`` with your Bitbucket username, and you will also need access to the source repository on the Bitbucket dewsurfacewater workspace.
