    this wrapper should be run around every data collection or movement that may disrupt
    the XBPM feedback.

    XBPM feedback isn't reliable during collections due to:
     * Objects (e.g. attenuator) crossing the beam can cause large (incorrect) feedback movements
     * Lower transmissions/higher energies are less reliable for the xbpm

    So we need to keep the transmission at 100% and the feedback on when not collecting
    and then turn it off and set the correct transmission for collection. The feedback
    mostly accounts for slow thermal drift so it is safe to assume that the beam is
    stable during a collection.

    In the case of a beam dump, undulator gap may not return. Therefore, we check here
    that the undulator gap is correct after XBPM is stable, and before collection.
