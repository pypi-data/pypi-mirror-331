A **product set** is a list of products which end customers aren't
aware, this list is defined by sales manager.

This module aims to load a product set in a sales order though a wizard.
The product set is a list of products and quantities that gets inserted
as separate sales order lines.

After a *product set* is added to the sales order, each line can be
updated or removed as any other sales order lines.
