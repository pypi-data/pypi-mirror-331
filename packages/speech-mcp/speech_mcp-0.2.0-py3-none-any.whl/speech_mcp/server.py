    # Speech MCP Usage Guide
    
    This MCP extension provides voice interaction capabilities with a simplified interface.
    
    ## How to Use
    
    1. Start a conversation:
       ```
       user_input = start_conversation()
       ```
       This initializes the speech recognition system, launches the UI, and immediately starts listening for user input.
       Note: The first time you run this, it will download the faster-whisper model which may take a moment.
    
    2. Reply to the user and get their response:
       ```
       user_response = reply("Your response text here")
       ```
       This speaks your response and then listens for the user's reply.
    
    ## Typical Workflow
    
    1. Start the conversation to get the initial user input
    2. Process the transcribed speech
    3. Use the reply function to respond and get the next user input
    4. Repeat steps 2-3 for a continuous conversation
    
    ## Example Conversation Flow
    
    ```python
    # Start the conversation
    user_input = start_conversation()
    
    # Process the input and generate a response
    # ...
    
    # Reply to the user and get their response
    follow_up = reply("Here's my response to your question.")
    
    # Process the follow-up and reply again
    reply("I understand your follow-up question. Here's my answer.")
    ```
    
    ## Tips
    
    - For best results, use a quiet environment and speak clearly
    - The system automatically detects silence to know when you've finished speaking
    - The listening timeout is set to 10 minutes to allow for natural pauses in conversation
