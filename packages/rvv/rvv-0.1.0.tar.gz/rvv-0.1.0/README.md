# RVV

RVV is a Python module that simulates the behavior of the RISC-V Vector Extension. It provides a framework for most of the RISCV-V Base Vector Extension assembly instructions along with few extra instruction mentioned below. 

## Additional Features

- **Vector Register Operations**  
  Load (`vle`, `vlm`) and store (`vse`, `vsm`) vector registers from/to NumPy arrays.  
  Retrieve vector registers using `get_vector_reg` with more options like LMUL, VL and viewtype.

- **Vector Mask Handling**
  Convert boolean arrays to vector mask registers (`bools_to_vm`) and vice versa (`vm_to_bools`), ensuring the first mask corresponds to the first element, the second to the second, etc.

- **Scalar and Floating-Point Register Operations**  
  Load and store operations for scalar registers (`lb`, `lh`, `lw`, `ld`, etc.) and floating-point registers (`flh`, `flw`, `flf`) are provided to emulate RISC-V behavior. Store operations returns the value of the registers. Float store operations are a bit inaccurate as they tend to do conversion. Additional unsigned scalar stors (`sbu`, `shu`, `swu` and `sdu`) were added to return unsigned values of registers.

- **Debugging Options**  
  Enable debugging for detailed internal state tracing via the `debug` flag
  Enable `debug_vm_as_v` flag to debug mask registers as simple uint8 registers. Note that mask are stored in Little Endian.

## Additional Notes

- **Vector Initialization**  
  All vector arrays are initialized with values from 0 to VLEN in bytes.

- **Vector Memory Options**  
  Vector Memory operations (`vle8`, `vse8`, etc.) work a little different. Contrary to asm, where only pointer is required, insturctions in this library require you to pass in a numpy array as memory, and offset in bytes.

- **Extensions**  
  You can add extensions from `rvv.extensions`. Right now only ZVFH extension is implemented. In example below, it is shown how to add an extension to base class.

- **Fractional LMULs**
  For Fractional LMULs (`mf2`, `mf4`, `mf8`) use `1/2`, `1/4`, `1/8`.

## Missing Features

- **Mask/Tail Agnostic**
  Currently, all instructions are by default mask and tail undisturbed.

- **Float Rounding Mode (FRM)**
  Currently, float rounding mode is same as numpy's default (Round to Nearest, ties to even)

- **Extensions**
  Extensions are currently to be added. Only ZVFH Extension has currently been added

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Usage

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a `RVV` object, configure vector length settings, and perform vector load/store operations:

```python
import numpy as np
from rvv import RVV

# Importing Extension
from rvv.extensions import ZVFH

# Create a RVV object with a vector length of 2048 bits and debugging enabled
rvv = RVV(VLEN=2048, debug=True)

# Enabling Extension
rvv = ZVFH(rvv).rvv

# Set the vector length configuration for 32-bit elements with LMUL=1
rvv.vsetvli(avl=4, e=32, m=1)  # avl=0 defaults to the maximum VL

# Load a vector register with a NumPy array
vector_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=np.int32)
rvv.vle(1, vector_data)

# Initializing memory and loading another vector register from it
memory = np.arange(100, dtype=np.int32)
rvv.vle32_v(2, memory, 12)

# Convert a boolean array to a vector mask
bool_mask = np.array([True, False, True, True], dtype=bool)
vmask = rvv.bools_to_vm(bool_mask)

# Load Mask
rvv.vlm(0, vmask)

# Perform RVV operations
rvv.vadd_vv(3, 2, 1)

# Store and print the contents of a vector register
stored_vector = rvv.vse(3)
print("Vector Register 2:", stored_vector)
```

### Class: `RVV`

#### Initialization
- **Parameters:**
  - `VLEN` (int, optional): Vector Length in bits (default: 2048).
  - `debug` (bool, optional): Enable debugging mode (default: False).
  - `debug_vm_as_v` (bool, optional): Debug vector mask register as vector uint8 (default: False).

- **Attributes:**
  - `VLEN`: Vector Length in bits.
  - `VLENB`: Vector Length in bytes.
  - `LMUL`: Vector Length Multiplier.
  - `VL`: Vector Length register.
  - `VLMAX`: Maximum Vector Length.
  - `SEW`: Standard Element Width.
  - `debug`: Debugging mode flag.
  - `debug_vm_as_v`: Flag to debug vector mask registers.

#### Methods

- **Vector Configuration**
  - `vsetvli(avl, e, m)`:  
    Sets the vector length configuration based on active vector length (`avl`), standard element width (`e`), and vector length multiplier (`m`).  
    Returns the effective vector length (VL).

- **All Base Extension Assembly instructions for RVV**

- **Vector Register Operations**
  - `vle(vd, inp)`:  
    Loads a vector register from a NumPy array. Supports conversion from lists and performs input size checks.
  - `vse(vd, out)`:  
    Stores a vector register into a NumPy array, or returns the vector if no output array is provided.
  - `get_vector_reg(vi, VL, LMUL, dtype)`:  
    Retrieves a vector register as a NumPy array view with the specified data type.

- **Mask Register Operations**
  - `vlm(vd, inp)`:  
    Loads a vector mask register from a NumPy array of `uint8` values.
  - `vsm(vd, out)`:  
    Stores a vector mask register into a NumPy array of `uint8` values.
  - `bools_to_vm(bool_array)`:  
    Converts a boolean array to a vector mask register. The boolean array is padded and reversed to match the RISC-V mask format, where the first mask corresponds to the first element.
  - `vm_to_bools(vbool)`:  
    Converts a vector mask register back into a standard boolean array, ensuring the first mask corresponds to the first element.

- **Scalar and Floating-Point Load/Store Operations**
  - **Scalar Loads:**  
    `lb`, `lbu`, `lh`, `lhu`, `lw`, `lwu`, `ld`  
    These methods load scalar values into the internal scalar register file (`_SRF`) with appropriate conversions.
  - **Scalar Stores:**  
    `sb`, `sbu`, `sh`, `shu`, `sw`, `swu`, `sd`, `sdu`  
    These methods return the stored scalar values from the register file.
  - **Floating-Point Loads/Stores:**  
    `flh`, `flw`, `flf` (for loading) and `fsh`, `fsw`, `fsd` (for storing)  
    These methods handle operations on the floating-point register file (`_FRF`).

### Code Structure
Code consists of main class BaseRVV that contains most of the common functions that are to be exposed to users, and those which are used internally by other class. To Cater for the sheer amount of instructions/functions, they have been divided into subclasses inside function dir. They have been classified according to [Intrinsics Viewer](https://dzaima.github.io/intrinsics-viewer/#0q1YqVbJSKsosTtYtU9JRSlSyilYqU4rVUUoGsoBUJlDWEASUagE). Each subclass extends from base class and adds respective type of functions. The RVV class exposed to users, is extended from these subclasses.
Each intruction (except from memory instructions), starts with one of the `_init_ops()` base class function and ends with `_post_op()` base class function. This allows for future changes that are universal to all functions easir (like adding tail and mask agnostic feature).
