# hoostus-beangulp-hooks

This uses machine learning, trained on your previous postings, to
predict what the second leg of an imported transaction should be.

# How to use it with beangulp.

## The easiest way.

1. Import it: ```from hoostus.beangulp.hooks import predict_posting```
1. Add the ```simple_hook``` to the list of hooks you send to beangulp.

In the ```importer.py``` you use with beangulp this might look something like:

```
from hoostus.beangulp.hooks import predict_posting
if __name__ == '__main__':
    importers = [ ... ]
    hooks = [predict_posting.simple_hook]
    ingest = beangulp.Ingest(importers, hooks)
    ingest()
```

## If you want to configure it.

Use ```predict_posting.hook``` directly and pass in a map of weights
and a list of denied accounts -- accounts you don't want to use for
training the machine learning model. Note that beangulp expects hooks to take
2 parameters but ```predict_posting.hook``` takes 4 paramters. This
means you will need to use functools.partial (or similar) to wrap it.

In the ```importer.py``` you use with beangulp this might look something like:
```
from hoostus.beangulp.hooks import predict_posting
import functools
if __name__ == '__main__':
    importers = [ ... ]
    
    my_weights = {'payee': 0.5, 'narration': 0.9, 'date.day': 0.2}
    my_denied_accounts = ['Expenses:Donuts']
    my_hook = functools.partial(predict_posting.hook, my_weights, my_denied_accounts)
    hooks = [my_hook]
    ingest = beangulp.Ingest(importers, hooks)
    ingest()
```

# Implementation Notes

The training is done on a per-account basis. Only transactions from the impoted_account
are considered.

Transactions involving closed accounts are removed from the training data.

Any transactions in the training data with a single leg are removed. This isn't valid
beancount syntax anyway and is an artifact of (what I believe to be) a bug in beangulp
which adds all of the recently imported transactions into the list of existing entries
provided to hooks. This muddies the training data, in some cases making it useless.

This is basically recycled from https://github.com/beancount/smart_importer but adapted
to the beangulp framework
