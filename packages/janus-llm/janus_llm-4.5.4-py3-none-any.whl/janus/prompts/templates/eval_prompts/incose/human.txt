Below is a snippet of {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} code to use as reference for the following task:
```
{SOURCE_CODE}
```

Given the above code and the list of requirements I will soon supply, please evaluate each requirement individually based on the following criteria:

C1 - Necessary: The need or requirement statement defines an essential capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor needed to satisfy a lifecycle concept, need, source, or parent requirement.
C2 - Appropriate: The specific intent and amount of detail of the need or requirement statement is appropriate to the level (the level of abstraction, organization, or system architecture) of the entity to which it refers.
C3 - Unambiguous: Need statements must be written such that the stakeholder intent is clear. Requirement statements must be stated such that the requirement can be interpreted in only one way by all the intended stakeholders.
C4 - Complete: The requirement statement sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor to meet the need, source, or parent requirement from which it was transformed without needing other information to understand the requirement.
C5 - Singular: The stakeholder need or requirement statement should state a single capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor.
C6 - Feasible: The need or requirement can be realized within entity constraints (for example: cost, schedule, technical, legal, ethical, safety) with acceptable risk.
C7 - Verifiable: The requirement statement is structured and worded such that its realization can be verified to the approving authorityâ€™s satisfaction.
C8 - Correct: The need statement must be an accurate representation of the lifecycle concept or source from which it was transformed. The requirement statement must be an accurate representation of the need, source, or parent requirement from which it was transformed.
C9 - Conforming: Individual needs and requirements should conform to an approved standard pattern and style guide or standard for writing and managing needs and requirements.

For each and every requirement below, you must indicate whether they "pass" or "fail" each of the above criteria. Briefly explain your reasoning before providing each pass/fail.

Your response should be formatted as a list of JSON objects, with each object corresponding to one requirement. Each object should include 10 keys: `requirement_id`, `C1`, `C2`, ..., `C9`. `requirement_id` should have a string value that holds the 8-character UUID associated with the requirement. The other four values should each be a JSON object with two keys: `reasoning` (a clear explanation of why the criterion is passed or failed) and a `score` (the literal string "pass" or "fail"). You should also include the requirement itself as a string value for the key `requirement`.

Be discerning in your evaluation; only very high-quality requirements should pass all criteria. Be a hard grader. If a requirement fails a criterion, be thorough and detailed in your explanation of why.

Below is an example output for a snippet of code with three labeled requirements:
```
{EXAMPLE_OUTPUT}
```

Here are the requirements that you are to evaluate:
{REQUIREMENTS}

Don't forget to include your final scores in JSON format!
