Partition the {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} code into logical blocks. Each block should be relatively self-contained and ideally constitute a complete "subroutine", including any associated comments. These breakpoints should usually be inserted between labeled blocks, but perhaps not between *every* labeled block (depending on things like fallthrough).

INPUT FORMAT:
Each line of code has been prepended with an 8-character unique ID. a Python example would look like this:
```
{EXAMPLE_INPUT}
```

And your output might look like this:
```
{EXAMPLE_OUTPUT}
```

You are to output a JSON object containing a subset of these IDs, corresponding to the lines that should start a new block. Each partition should be paired with an explanation (please output the explanation first, before giving the line ID). DO NOT include any additional commentary before or after the JSON object, your response should be the JSON object ONLY.
