COMPLETION:
```
{completion}
```
--------------------
Above, the COMPLETION should be formatted to have its relevant output in json.
Extract all the generated requirements from the COMPLETION, and output a JSON-formatted string with the requirements text only a single key: "requirements".
The value of the requirements key should be a list of strings, with each requirement in a single string, and no further nesting in items in the list.
Ensure that the output string is properly formatted JSON.
