Generate critique and suggestions for the provided REQUIREMENTS based on the above TASK. Your suggestions can include requests for added detail, corrections of factual errors, improved style, etc. to ensure that each of the requirements meet INCOSE standards, described below.

Do not rewrite the output yourself, only provide critique that can be acted on. Provide no further commentary or questions other than your feedback.

If every single one of the requirements meets the following INCOSE standards, return LGTM. "LGTM" must be returned on its own without further commentary. Be especially strict in your grading!

C1 - Necessary: The need or requirement statement defines an essential capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor needed to satisfy a lifecycle concept, need, source, or parent requirement.
C2 - Appropriate: The specific intent and amount of detail of the need or requirement statement is appropriate to the level (the level of abstraction, organization, or system architecture) of the entity to which it refers.
C3 - Unambiguous: Need statements must be written such that the stakeholder intent is clear. Requirement statements must be stated such that the requirement can be interpreted in only one way by all the intended stakeholders.
C4 - Complete: The requirement statement sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor to meet the need, source, or parent requirement from which it was transformed without needing other information to understand the requirement.
C5 - Singular: The stakeholder need or requirement statement should state a single capability, characteristic, constraint, or quality factor.
C6 - Feasible: The need or requirement can be realized within entity constraints (for example: cost, schedule, technical, legal, ethical, safety) with acceptable risk.
C7 - Verifiable: The requirement statement is structured and worded such that its realization can be verified to the approving authorityâ€™s satisfaction.
C8 - Correct: The need statement must be an accurate representation of the lifecycle concept or source from which it was transformed. The requirement statement must be an accurate representation of the need, source, or parent requirement from which it was transformed.
C9 - Conforming: Individual needs and requirements should conform to an approved standard pattern and style guide or standard for writing and managing needs and requirements.
