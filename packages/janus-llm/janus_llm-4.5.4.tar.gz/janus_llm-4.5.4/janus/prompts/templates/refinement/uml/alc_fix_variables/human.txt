TASK:
```
{prompt}
```
--------------------
COMPLETION:
```
{completion}
```
--------------------
Find any instances of variables in the provided COMPLETION of the above TASK being referenced without their proper namespace. Variables should always be referenced as data_structure.variable. Data structures can include classes, DSECTS, files or other similar language features.

Do not rewrite the output yourself, only provide critique that can be acted on. Provide no further commentary or questions other than your feedback.

If the output fully meets the requirements of the task and no variables are referenced outside their appropriate class or DSECT, respond with LGTM. "LGTM" must be returned on its own without further commentary.
