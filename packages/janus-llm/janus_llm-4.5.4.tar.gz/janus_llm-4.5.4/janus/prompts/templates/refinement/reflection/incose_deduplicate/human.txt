TASK:
```
{prompt}
```
--------------------
REQUIREMENTS:
```
{completion}
```
--------------------

In order for software requirements to be useful for software modernization, they must be reasonably consise and not overly specific to the syntax of the legacy language of the code which they describe. With this in mind, for the provided TASK, suggest ways that the REQUIREMENTS could be less redundant. If the REQUIREMENTS include duplicated or unnecessary requirements, explain how some of them could be combined to reduce this number. If the REQUIREMENTS refer to specific aspects of the original coding language which would not be useful to a software developer porting the code to a new language, point it out.

Do not rewrite the output yourself, only provide critique that can be acted on. Provide no further commentary or questions other than your feedback.

If the requirements in the completion above are adequately consise, return LGTM. "LGTM" must be returned on its own without further commentary.
