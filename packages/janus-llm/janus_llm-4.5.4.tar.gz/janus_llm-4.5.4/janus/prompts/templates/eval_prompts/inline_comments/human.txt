Please evaluate each comment in the provided {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} code based on the following criteria:

Completeness - Does the comment address all capabilities of the relevant source code?

4 - All essential functionality is documented.
3 - Most essential functionality is documented.
2 - Little essential functionality is documented.
1 - No essential functionality is documented.


Hallucination - Does the comment provide true information?

4 - The comment provides only true information.
3 - The comment provides mostly true information.
2 - The comment provides mostly untrue information.
1 - The comment is completely untrue.


Readability - Is the comment clear to read?

4 - The comment is well-written.
3 - The comment has few problems.
2 - The comment has many problems.
1 - The comment is unreadable.

Usefulness - Is the comment useful?

4 - The comment helps an expert programmer understand the code better.
3 - The comment helps an average programmer understand the code better.
2 - The comment documents only trivial functionality.
1 - The comment is not useful at any level.


Look through the code and find each individual comment, they will be deliniated by <BLOCK_COMMENT id> or <INLINE_COMMENT id> where "id" is an 8-character UUID for the comment that follows.

Each comment should be evaluated independently based on the above criteria. Your response should be formatted as a list of JSON objects, with each object corresponding to one comment. Each object should include five keys: `comment_id`, `completeness`, `hallucination`, `readability`, and `usefulness`. `comment_id` should have a string value that holds the 8-character UUID associated with the comment. The other four values should each be a JSON object with two keys: `reasoning` (a clear explanation of why the criteria is rated the way it is) and `score` (an integer rating from 1 to 4).

Be discerning in your evaluation; only very high-quality comments should get top marks. Be a hard grader. If a comment is rated low, be thorough and detailed in your explanation of your score.

Below is an example output for a snippet of code with three labeled comments:
```{EXAMPLE_OUTPUT}```


Evaluate the following code:
```
{SOURCE_CODE}
```

Don't forget to include your final scores in JSON format!
