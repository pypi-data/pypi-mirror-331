    "2. Testing for the CACBAR constant shall verify that it is recognized by the software as indicating the beginning of a DFHCOMMAREA and that it has been assigned a numeric value of 12 and that it is secure and that it is understandable and the testing must have 100% coverage and it must return useful content to a mixed audience.",
    "3. The MS_WAIT field shall be a fullword integer (4 bytes) designed to store a wait time ranging from 1 millisecond to 900 milliseconds.",
    "4. The software shall consider the DFHEISTG data structure as the end of a dynamic storage area.",
    "5. The software shall recognize a constant named CACBAR, which is equivalent to the numeric value 12, indicating the beginning of a DFHCOMMAREA from the requesting program.",
