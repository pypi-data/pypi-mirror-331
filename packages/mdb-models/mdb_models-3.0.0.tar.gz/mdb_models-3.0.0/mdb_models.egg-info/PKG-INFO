<hr />

### Installation
1. Install the python package via pip:

```bash
pip install mdb-models
```
**Note**: It is better to create a python virtual environment...

2. Setup an environment variables:
   
   - To create an environment variables, simply create a file named **".env"**.
    - Then, add these following variables to a created file:

    ```bash
    MONGO_DB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27020" # The default mongodb localhost but you can also put a connection string from atlas server.
    MONGO_DB_NAME="my_database" # Your created database
    ```

3. To create a model you can simply enter this command on a command promt:

```bash
generate-model /models/test.py  # where '/models/test_model.py' is your file path and file name

# ============== or ===============

generate-authmodel /models/user.py # creates an authenticatable model
```

4. It will generate a file like this:

```python
#A MongoDB model for the tests collection
from mdb_models.base import BaseMongoModel

class Test(BaseMongoModel):
    
    collection_name = 'tests' # Create a collection with this name in the database
```
