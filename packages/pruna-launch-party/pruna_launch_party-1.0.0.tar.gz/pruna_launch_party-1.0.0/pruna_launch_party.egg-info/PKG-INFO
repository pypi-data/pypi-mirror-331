# ðŸŽ‰ Pruna Launch Party

Celebrate Pruna's open-source launch with this fun package!

## Installation

```bash
pip install pruna-launch-party --extra-index-url "<Event Location>"
```

## What's this?

Pruna is now open-source, and we're throwing a party to celebrate our most public commit yet! This package brings the party to your terminal.

When you install this package, you'll see:
- Launch confirmation
- AI jokes (compressed, of course)
- High-energy vibes
- And more surprises!

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simulated launch sequence
- ðŸ¤– AI-powered party vibes
- ðŸŽµ Terminal celebrations
- ðŸŽ¨ Colorful output

## Usage

After installation, just run:

```bash
launch_open_source
```

And watch the celebration unfold!

## Note

We've spent months pruning, quantizing, distilling... Now it's time to decompress (for once, that means us! Don't worry, we're still compressing models.)

Come for the `pip install pruna`, stay for the `pip install fun`. ðŸŽ‰
