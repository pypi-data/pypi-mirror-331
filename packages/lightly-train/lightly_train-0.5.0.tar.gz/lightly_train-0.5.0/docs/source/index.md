*Build better computer vision models faster with self-supervised pre-training*

## Why LightlyTrain?

Lightly**Train** uses self-supervised learning (SSL) to train computer vision models on
large datasets **without labels**. It provides simple Python, Command Line, and Docker
interfaces to train models with popular SSL methods such as DINO and SimCLR.

The trained models are ideal starting points for fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as
image **classification**, **object detection**, and **segmentation** or for generating
**image embeddings**. Models trained with Lightly**Train** result in
**improved performance**, **faster convergence**, and better **generalization** compared
to models trained without SSL. Image embeddings created with Lightly**Train** capture more
relevant information than their supervised counterparts and seamlessly extend to new
classes due to the unsupervised nature of SSL.

Lightly is the expert in SSL for computer vision and developed Lightly**Train** to simplify
model training for any task and dataset.

## How It Works

### Train a Model with SSL

```python
import lightly_train

lightly_train.train(
    out="out/my_experiment",            # Output directory
    data="my_data_dir",                 # Directory with images
    model="torchvision/resnet50",       # Model to train
    method="dino",                      # Self-supervised learning method
)
```

This will pretrain a Torchvision ResNet-50 model using images from `my_data_dir` and the
DINO self-supervised learning method. All training logs, model exports, and checkpoints
are saved to the output directory at `out/my_experiment`.

The final model is exported to `out/my_experiment/exported_models/exported_last.pt` in
the default format of the used library. It can directly be used for
fine-tuning. Follow the [example](quick_start.md#fine-tune) to learn how to
fine-tune a model.

After training is complete, you can either use the exported model for fine-tuning,
or use the model to [generate image embeddings](#generate-image-embeddings).

### Generate Image Embeddings

```python
import lightly_train

lightly_train.embed(
    out="my_embeddings.pth",                                # Exported embeddings
    checkpoint="out/my_experiment/checkpoints/last.ckpt",   # LightlyTrain checkpoint
    data="my_data_dir",                                     # Directory with images
    format="torch",                                         # Embedding format
)
```

You can now use the generated embeddings for clustering, retrieval, or visualization
tasks.
