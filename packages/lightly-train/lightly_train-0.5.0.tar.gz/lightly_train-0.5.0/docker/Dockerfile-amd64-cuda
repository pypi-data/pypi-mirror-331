# Builds lightly/train:latest image on DockerHub. TODO: Add link
# Image is CUDA-optimized for single/multi-GPU training and inference

# Start FROM PyTorch image https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch
# We use CUDA 11.8 because it is compatible with older CUDA Drivers (>=450.80.02 linux, >=452.39 windows).
# See https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/#minor-version-compatibility
# The CUDA Driver is the only component from the host system that has to be compatible with the docker image.
# The PyTorch and cuDNN versions are independent of the host system.
#
# The PyTorch 2.5.1 image comes with Python 3.11.
