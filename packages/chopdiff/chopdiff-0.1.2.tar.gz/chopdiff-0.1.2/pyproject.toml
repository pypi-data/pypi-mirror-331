# Auto-generated version for builds based on git tag or commit.

# Preferred styles of versioning (PEP 440 compliant):
#   1.2.3               (stable release)
#   1.2.3a4             (pre-release, no dash or dots)
#   1.2.3rc1            (release candidate)
#   1.2.3.dev4+abcdef12 (development build, .dev for dev releases and +commit hash)
#
# Tags with a "v" prefix (e.g., v1.2.3) or additional dots (e.g., v1.2.3.rc1) are recognized
# but normalized to the preferred style for distribution.
