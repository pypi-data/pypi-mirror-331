## Documentation

The full documentation is available on **[GitHub Pages](https://fox-techniques.github.io/irene-sankey/)**.

## Overview

**IRENE-Sankey** offers an easy-to-use interface for creating Sankey diagrams, which are ideal for visualizing flow distributions across different categories or entities. The package is built to work seamlessly with modern [Polars](https://pola.rs/) or Pandas dataframes and provides a range of customization options for colors, labels, and node arrangements, making it perfect for data analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in visualizing complex flows.


## Features

- **Simple Sankey Diagrams**: Easily create source-target pair and customize Sankey diagrams from Polars or Pandas DataFrames.
- **Customizable Styles**: Customize colors, labels, node spacing, and flow thickness to suit your needs.
- **Support for Large Diagrams**: Efficiently handles larger flows and multiple nodes.
- **Integrates with Polars and Pandas**: Easily map columns and rows from Polars or Pandas DataFrames to nodes and links.


## Installation

Install **IRENE-Sankey** using pip:

```bash
pip install irene-sankey
```

> **Note**: Requires Python 3.10 or above.


## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example to create a simple Sankey diagram with **IRENE-Sankey**.

```python
import polars as pl

from irene_sankey.core.traverse import traverse_sankey_flow
from irene_sankey.plots.sankey import plot_irene_sankey_diagram

# Sample data to test the functionality
df = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "country": ["NL","NL","NL","DE","DE","FR","FR","FR","US","US","US"],
        "industry": [
            "Technology","Finance","Healthcare",
            "Automotive","Engineering",
            "Technology","Agriculture","Healthcare",
            "Manufacturing","Technology","Finance"],
        "field": [
            "Software","Banking","Pharmaceuticals",
            "Car Manufacturing","Mechanical Engineering",
            "Software","Crop Science","Medical Devices",
            "Electronics","AI & Robotics","Investment Banking"],
    }
)

# Generate source-target pair, node map and link for Sankey diagrams
flow_df, node_map, link = traverse_sankey_flow(df, ["", "country", "industry", "field"])

# Plot Sankey diagram 
fig = plot_irene_sankey_diagram(node_map, link, title = "Irene-Sankey Demo", node_config={
        "pad": 10,
        "line": dict(color="black", width=1),
    }
)
fig.show()
```

## Usage

The core function in the **IRENE-Sankey** package is `traverse_sankey_flow`. By passing a Polars or Pandas DataFrame and selecting string columns in the order of the flow, you can quickly generate a required source-target pair map to generate Sankey diagram.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed their knowledge and support, making this project possible. Special thanks to [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock) and [Yan Holtz](https://www.yan-holtz.com/) for their invaluable inspiration and insights, which profoundly influenced the direction and development of this project. Their expertise and knowledge were instrumental in shaping its final form. I am also grateful to the Plotly team for their incredible library, enabling the creation of beautiful, interactive visualizations that bring the data to life.

Special thanks to the contributors and the open-source community for their support and feedback. The Sankey visualization method is inspired by [Matplotlib's Sankey capabilities](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/specialty_plots/sankey_basics.html), with enhancements for customization and usability.
