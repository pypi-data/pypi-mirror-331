# **some student le**
<h2>really not good</h2>
<p>-by Dr Lo (my math teacher)</p>

This is a library containing 1 single line
the line rewrites some module (mostly built-in functions) into some impractical fancy function designed to replace the original

To use it, simply do `from some_student_le.really_not_good import *`  and watch the magic happen

(its buggy I know, but only when you use it with random advance thingy like the original)

<br><br>

*KNOWN ISSUE:*
- input doesn't allow the prompt to include ANSI code
- non-tty terminal cannot enjoy the effect (errors)
- editing/moving/changing size of the terminal (I dont actually know how it happen or when, but it just do, I cant even recreate it on purpose it just happens randomly) mid-print/mid-input results in ANSI code leaking (somehow)

***Development log:***<br>
*(every version not shown here is either not exist or deleted for various reasons)*
| version |    info    |   yanked    |
|---------|------------|-------------|
|0.0.0    | test version to see if the test platform works under 2 different versions of the project<br>also see if anything is wrong on PyPI|**YES**|
|0.0.1    | more testing on top of 0.0.0, some bug fixed|**YES**|
|1.0.1    | first release, featuring typewrite-like animated effect for `print` and `input` (cause I accidentally deleted 1.0.0 so its now 1.0.1)|**YES**|
|1.0.3    | fixed a typo on readme where it's telling you to import the wrong thing to use it|**YES**|
|1.0.4    | fixed a bug where PyPI 1 version cannot be used (since the 2 versions are released together, one went wrong and the other need to be updated too so...)<br>Also added the link to 2 versions to README.md|**YES**|
|1.0.6    | fixed the issue where you could delete words that are printed instead of inputted, which normally couldn't. Also fixed that you cant delete your input if it was too long it truncated to the next line.|**YES**|
|1.0.7    | fixed the print to file results in gribbish issue by not having the animation for non-stdout files.|**YES**|
|1.0.8    | fixed 1.0.7 which somehow is completely doomed because I forgot a "not" in a comparison.|**NO**|
