# Cambridge Sports Analytics Prediction Engine

Welcome to the **CSA Prediction Engine** package. This Python library provides a suite of tools and functions for performing relevance-based predictions using the Cambridge Sports Analytics (CSA) API. The package is designed to facilitate single and multi-task predictions, allowing for flexible model evaluation and experimentation.

## Key Features

- **Single Task Predictions**: Support for predictions with one dependent variable and one set of circumstances.
- **Multi-y Predictions**: Perform predictions with multiple dependent variables and a single set of circumstances.
- **Multi-theta Predictions**: Perform predictions with one dependent variable and multiple sets of circumstances.
- **Relevance-Based Grid Predictions**: Generate optimal predictions by evaluating all thresholds and variable combinations.
- **Grid Singularity Predictions**: Analyze grid predictions to find the singular optimal solution.
- **MaxFit Predictions**: Find the best-fit model based on adjusted relevance.
