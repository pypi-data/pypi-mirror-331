    <h3><b>Fetch transactions from Viseca One</b></h3>
</div>

```sh
>>> uv add viseca
```


## Usage

This method processes the auth flow in the CLI and will trigger a 2FA request like the login in a browser would.

1. Log in to [one.viseca.ch](https://one.viseca.ch) and navigate to "Transactions"
1. Obtain the card ID from the path (between `/v1/card/` and `/transactions`) and store it in your `.env` file. Additionaly, to avoid entering your credentials everytime, feel free to add them to the `.env` file as well. 
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    >>> VISECA_USERNAME=YOUR_MAIL
    >>> VISECA_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
    >>> VISECA_CARD_ID=YOUR_CARD_ID
    ```
1.  Fetch transactions (and save them to a file)
    - Using commands
    ```sh
    uv run viseca/transactions.py --file transactions.csv
    ```
    - Or the python package
    ```python
    from viseca import VisecaClient, format_transactions

    client = VisecaClient()
    txs = client.list_transactions()
    df = format_transactions(txs)
    df.to_csv("transactions.csv")
    ```
