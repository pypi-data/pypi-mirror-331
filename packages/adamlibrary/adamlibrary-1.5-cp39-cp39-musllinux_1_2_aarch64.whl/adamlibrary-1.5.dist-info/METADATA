# Adamlibrary Project

In my **Adamlibrary** project, which I developed to bring low-level operations in basic C functions to Python, you can now use low-level C functions directly from Python.

## Windows Support
- ✅ Low-level memory management
- ❌ Graphic-based memory and window management
- ✅ Data structure management


## Supports Brought for UNIX POSIX Compatible Devices
- ✅ Low-level memory management
- ❌ Graphic-based buffer management unit
- ✅ Data structure management

Necessary support for DOS-based systems will come in the near future versions.

## Dependencies
- GCC
- ctypes
- util-linux
- Win32 system architecture libraries

You can visit this site for a sample `test.py` code: [GitHub Test Code](https://github.com/Goychay23/int/tree/main/Adamlibrary/test/test.py)
