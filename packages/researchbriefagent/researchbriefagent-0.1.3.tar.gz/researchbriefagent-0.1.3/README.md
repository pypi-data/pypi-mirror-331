A Python library for an AI agent that generates concise research briefs from web searches using LangChain, Anthropic's Claude, and Tavily search.

## Overview

The `ResearchBriefAgent` automates the process of researching a topic and producing a structured brief, including key points and sources. Built with LangChain's ecosystem, it leverages Anthropic's Claude model for reasoning and Tavily for web search, with SQLite-backed memory for context persistence.

## Features

- **Topic-Based Research**: Generate briefs on any topic with a single function call.
- **Structured Output**: Receive formatted briefs with key points and cited sources.
- **Memory Persistence**: Retain conversation context across queries using SQLite checkpointing.
- **Extensible**: Built on LangChain, allowing integration with additional tools and models.

## Installation

Install the library via PyPI:

```bash
pip install researchbriefagent
```
# Usage
```
from researchbriefagent import ResearchBriefAgent
agent = ResearchBriefAgent(anthropic_api_key="your_anthropic_api_key", tavily_api_key="your_tavily_api_key")
brief = agent.generate_brief("Impact of renewable energy on climate change")
print(brief)
```
Example Output:
## Research Brief: Impact of renewable energy on climate change
### Key Points
- Reduces greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels.
- Solar and wind power adoption has surged globally.
- Critical for limiting warming to 1.5Â°C.
