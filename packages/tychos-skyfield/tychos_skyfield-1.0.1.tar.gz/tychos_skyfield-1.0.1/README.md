# tychos_skyfield

Tychos (Tychosium) implementation in Python3 (base library) and integration to the Skyfield.

The project enables users to use Tychos model directly in Python and to use it along Skyfield package, which allows them to do practical computations for planets, stars and satellites.

The project Python library dependencies are:
-  numpy
-  scipy
-  skyfield (only for tychos skyfield library)

The best way to test the library is either to clone this repository, or to copy the library files directly to a local directory.
Then install the Python library dependencies in the associated project virtual environment.
The library was tested to work with numpy version 2.2.1, scipy version 1.15.1 and skyfield version 1.51.

There are two example files in the Examples directory:
- example_native.py
- example_skyfield.py
  
that demonstrates how to use Tychos libraries practically.
