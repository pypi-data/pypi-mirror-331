We can generally divide the `Election` object's life cycle into three distinct phases with different callable methods.

So you start wondering: What if these two parties ran together as one? Would this improve their result? Would they get more or less seats if they ran together? To answer these questions, we need to merge two parties in the `Election` object and add together their votes. This could also be done with the raw data before the object creation, but the `Election` object has a method specificall for this task that is often easier to use. We will demonstrate this method here on our ISDF example.\n",
