# gofannon  
  
**gofannon** is a collection of tools designed to enhance the capabilities of function-calling-enabled language models. These tools provide additional functionality for various tasks, including mathematical operations, GitHub interactions, arXiv searches, and advanced reasoning techniques.  

## Why the name `gofanon` ?

See [`why_the_name_gofannon.md`](./why_the_name_gofannon.md) for the rich story on why we chose to honor this Celtic Diety

## Features  
  
- **Basic Math Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.  
- **GitHub Integration**: Interact with GitHub repositories, including creating issues, committing files, and retrieving repository contents.  
- **arXiv Search**: Search for and retrieve articles from arXiv.  
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning techniques for complex problem-solving.  
- **NHTSA Complaints**: Retrieve vehicle complaint data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  
  
## Roadmap  
  
For a detailed overview of planned features and their current status, please refer to the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md).
