**_Terratalk_** is a simple tool to add an opinionated terraform plan output
into your pull-request as a comment. This allows you to have a quick feedback on
infrastructure changes without having to leave the context of your pull-request
view.

## Setup

### Prerequisite

This tool relies on either
[Bitbucket Branch Source](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source/)
or [GitHub Branch Source](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/) to
be installed as a plugin on your Jenkins. Alternatively you can set the
environment variable `CHANGE_URL` to the URL of the pull-request which will
allow `terratalk` to construct the proper API request to your SCM.

GitLab is currently only supported from gitlab-pipelines.

### Installation

On the build agent, install `terratalk`:

```bash
$ pip install --user terratalk
```

If you are using GitHub you will additionally need to install the following:

```bash
$ pip install --user PyGithub
```

If you are using GitLab you will additionally need to install the following:

```bash
$ pip install --user python-gitlab
```

### Running

Execute in the same directory, optionally with the same `TF_DATA_DIR` as you
would normally run `terraform`. If you use
[`tfenv`](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) that will work as well.

```bash
$ terraform plan -out WORKSPACE.plan
$ terratalk comment -w WORKSPACE
```

### Supported providers

#### Bitbucket Server (Jenkins)

* `STASH_USER`
* `STASH_PASS`

#### Bitbucket Cloud (Jenkins)

* `BITBUCKET_USERNAME`
* `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD`

#### GitHub (Jenkins)
