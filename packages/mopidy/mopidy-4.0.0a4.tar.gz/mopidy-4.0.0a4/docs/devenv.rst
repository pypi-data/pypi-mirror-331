***********************
Development environment
***********************

This page describes a common development setup for working with Mopidy and
Mopidy extensions. Of course, there may be other ways that work better for you
and the tools you use, but here's one recommended way to do it.

.. contents::
   :local:


Initial setup
=============

The following steps help you get a good initial setup. They build on each other
to some degree, so if you're not very familiar with Python development it might
be wise to proceed in the order laid out here.

.. contents::
   :local:


Install Mopidy the regular way
------------------------------

Install Mopidy the regular way. Mopidy has some non-Python dependencies which
may be tricky to install. Thus we recommend to always start with a full regular
Mopidy install, as described in :ref:`installation`. That is, if you're running
e.g. Debian, start with installing Mopidy from Debian packages.


Make a development workspace
----------------------------

Make a directory to be used as a workspace for all your Mopidy development::

    mkdir ~/mopidy-dev

It will contain all the Git repositories you'll check out when working on
Mopidy and extensions.


Make a virtualenv
-----------------

Make a Python virtualenv for Mopidy development.
The virtualenv will wall off Mopidy and its dependencies from the rest of your system.
All development and installation of Python dependencies,
versions of Mopidy, and extensions are done inside the virtualenv.
This way your regular Mopidy install,
which you set up in the first step,
is unaffected by your hacking and will always be working.

To create a virtualenv in the Mopidy workspace directory, run::

    python3 -m venv ~/mopidy-dev/.venv

Now, each time you open a terminal and want to activate the ``mopidy``
virtualenv, run::

    . ~/mopidy-dev/.venv/bin/activate

There are lots of ways to set up your shell to automatically activate the virtualenv,
e.g. when changing directory into ``~/mopidy-dev/`` or a subdirectory.
As this is just convenience and not strictly required,
it is left as an exercise for the reader.


Clone the repo from GitHub
--------------------------

Once inside the virtualenv, it's time to clone the ``mopidy/mopidy`` Git repo
from GitHub::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/
    git clone https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git

When you've cloned the ``mopidy`` Git repo, ``cd`` into it::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/mopidy/

With a fresh clone of the Git repo, you should start out on the ``main``
branch. This is where all features for the next feature release land. To
confirm that you're on the right branch, run::

    git branch


Install Mopidy from the Git repo
--------------------------------

Next up, we'll want to run Mopidy from the Git repo. There's two reasons for
this: first of all, it lets you easily change the source code, restart Mopidy,
and see the change take effect. Second, it's a convenient way to keep at the
bleeding edge, testing the latest developments in Mopidy itself or test some
extension against the latest Mopidy changes.

Assuming you're still inside the Git repo, use pip to install Mopidy from the
Git repo in an "editable" form::

    pip install --upgrade --editable .

When using the ``--editable`` flag, the source code is not copied into the
virtualenv's ``site-packages`` directory, but instead creates a link there
pointing to the Git repo. This way, you can change the source code in the Git
repo and the changes will be visible inside the virtualenv without having to
reinstall Mopidy.

It will also create a ``mopidy`` executable inside the virtualenv that will
always run the latest code from the Git repo::

    $ cat ~/mopidy-dev/.venv/bin/mopidy
    ...

This file is on the path when the virtualenv is active, so you can run it from
anywhere, simply by running::

    mopidy

.. note::

    It is also possible to run Python apps directly,
    e.g. using ``python3 src/mopidy`` directly on the
    :file:`~/mopidy-dev/mopidy/src/mopidy/` Python package directory.
    However, if you don't run the install command above,
    the extensions bundled with Mopidy will not be registered and made available
    for use, making Mopidy quite useless.

Third, the install command will register the bundled Mopidy
extensions so that Mopidy may find them through :mod:`importlib`.
The result of this can be seen in a file named :file:`entry_points.txt`
which can be found inside the virtualenv dir, e.g.
:file:`~/mopidy-dev/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/Mopidy-4.0.0.dist-info/entry_points.txt`.
The :file:`entry_points.txt` file is of special interest as it shows both how
the above executable and the bundled extensions are connected to the Mopidy
source code:

.. code-block:: ini

    [console_scripts]
    mopidy = mopidy.__main__:main

    [mopidy.ext]
    file = mopidy.file:Extension
    http = mopidy.http:Extension
    m3u = mopidy.m3u:Extension
    softwaremixer = mopidy.softwaremixer:Extension
    stream = mopidy.stream:Extension


Install development tools
-------------------------

Before continuing, you will probably want to install the development tools we
use as well. These can be installed into the active virtualenv by running::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/mopidy/
    pip install --upgrade --editable ".[dev]"

Note that this is the same command as you used to install Mopidy from the Git
repo, with the addition of the ``[dev]`` suffix after ``.``. This makes pip
install the "dev" set of extra dependencies. Exactly what the "dev" set
includes are defined in :file:`pyproject.toml`.

To upgrade the development tools in the future, just rerun the exact same
command.


.. _running-from-git:

Running Mopidy from Git
=======================

As long as the virtualenv is activated, you can start Mopidy from any
directory. Simply run::

    mopidy

To stop it again, press :kbd:`Ctrl+C`.

Every time you change code in Mopidy or an extension and want to see it
live, you must restart Mopidy.

If you want to iterate quickly while developing, it may sound a bit tedious to
restart Mopidy for every minor change. Then it's useful to have tests to
exercise your code...


.. _running-tests:

Running tests
=============

Mopidy has quite good test coverage, and we would like all new code going into
Mopidy to come with tests.

.. contents::
   :local:


Test it all
-----------

You need to know at least one command; the one that runs all the tests::

    tox

This will run exactly the same tests as our CI setup runs for all our
branches and pull requests. If this command turns green, you can be quite
confident that your pull request will get the green flag from CI as well,
which is a requirement for it to be merged.

As this is the ultimate test command, it's also the one taking the most time to
run; up to a minute, depending on your system. But, if you have patience, this
is all you need to know. Always run this command before pushing your changes to
GitHub.

If you take a look at the tox config file, :file:`tox.ini`, you'll see that tox
runs tests in multiple environments, including a ``ruff`` environment that
lints the source code for issues and a ``docs`` environment that tests that the
documentation can be built. You can also limit tox to just test specific
environments using the ``-e`` option, e.g. to run just unit tests on Python 3.11::

    tox -e py311

To learn more, see the `tox documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ .

Before submitting a pull request, we recommend running::

    tox

This will locally run similar tests to what we use in our CI runs and help us to
merge high-quality contributions.


Running unit tests
------------------

Under the hood, ``tox -e py311`` will use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_
as the test runner. We can also use it directly to run all tests::

    pytest

pytest has lots of possibilities, so you'll have to dive into their docs and
plugins to get full benefit from it. To get you interested, here are some
examples.

We can limit to just tests in a single directory to save time::

    pytest tests/http/

With the help of the ``pytest-xdist`` plugin, we can run tests with four Python
processes in parallel, which usually cuts the test time in half or more::

    pytest -n 4

Another useful feature from ``pytest-xdist``, is the possibility to stop on the
first test failure, watch the file system for changes, and then rerun the
tests. This makes for a very quick code-test cycle::

    pytest -f    # or --looponfail

With the help of the pytest-cov plugin, we can get a report on what parts of
the given module are covered by the test suite::

    pytest --cov

.. note::

    Up to date test coverage statistics can also be viewed online at
    `Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/mopidy/mopidy>`_.

If we want to speed up the test suite, we can even get a list of the ten
slowest tests::

    pytest --durations=10

By now, you should be convinced that running pytest directly during
development can be very useful.


Continuous integration
----------------------

Mopidy uses `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy/actions>`_ for
automatically running the test suite when code is pushed to GitHub. This
works both for the main Mopidy repo, but also for any forks. This way, any
contributions to Mopidy through GitHub will automatically be tested, and the
build status will be visible in the GitHub pull request interface, making it
easier to evaluate the quality of pull requests.

For each successful build, the CI setup submits code coverage data to
`Codecov`_. If you're out of work, Codecov might help you find areas in the
code which could need better test coverage.


.. _code-linting:

Style checking and linting
--------------------------

We're quite pedantic about :ref:`codestyle` and try hard to keep the Mopidy
code base a very clean and nice place to work in.

Luckily, you can get very far by using the `ruff
<https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>`_ linter to check your code for issues before
submitting a pull request. Mopidy's ruff rules are configured in :file:`pyproject.toml`.
You can either run the ``ruff`` tox environment, like our CI setup will do on
your pull request::

    tox -e ruff

Or you can run ruff directly::

    ruff .

If successful, the command will not print anything at all.

.. note::

    In some rare cases it doesn't make sense to listen to ruff's warnings. In
    those cases, ignore the check by appending ``# noqa: <warning code>`` to
    the source line that triggers the warning. The ``# noqa`` part will make
    ruff skip all checks on the line, while the warning code will help other
    developers lookup what you are ignoring.


.. _writing-docs:

Writing documentation
=====================

To write documentation, we use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. See
their site for lots of documentation on how to use Sphinx.

.. note::

    To generate a few graphs which are part of the documentation, you need to
    install the graphviz package. You can install it from APT with::

        sudo apt install graphviz

    Other distributions typically use the same package name.

To build the documentation, go into the :file:`docs/` directory::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/mopidy/docs/

Then, to see all available build targets, run::

    make

To generate an HTML version of the documentation, run::

    make html

The generated HTML will be available at :file:`_build/html/index.html`. To open
it in a browser you can run either of the following commands, depending on your
OS::

    xdg-open _build/html/index.html    # Linux
    open _build/html/index.html        # OS X

The documentation at https://docs.mopidy.com/ is hosted by `Read the Docs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_, which automatically updates the documentation
when a change is pushed to the ``mopidy/mopidy`` repo at GitHub.


Working on extensions
=====================

Much of the above also applies to Mopidy extensions, though they're often a bit
simpler. They don't have documentation sites and their test suites are either
small and fast, or sadly missing entirely. Most of them use tox to run various
linters, and pytest can be used to run their test suites.

.. contents::
   :local:


Installing extensions
---------------------

As always, the ``mopidy`` virtualenv should be active when working on
extensions::

    . ~/mopidy-dev/.venv/bin/activate

Just like with non-development Mopidy installations, you can install extensions
using pip::

    pip install Mopidy-Scrobbler

Installing an extension from its Git repo works the same way as with Mopidy
itself. First, go to the Mopidy workspace::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/

Clone the desired Mopidy extension::

    git clone https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify.git

Change to the newly created extension directory::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/mopidy-spotify/

Then, install the extension in "editable" mode, so that it can be imported from
anywhere inside the virtualenv and the extension is registered and discoverable
through :mod:`importlib`::

    pip install --editable .

Every extension will have a ``README.rst`` file. It may contain information
about extra dependencies required, development process, etc. Extensions usually
have a changelog in their GitHub relases page.


Upgrading extensions
--------------------

Extensions often have a much quicker life cycle than Mopidy itself, often with
daily releases in periods of active development. To find outdated extensions in
your virtualenv, you can run::

    pip list --outdated

To upgrade an extension installed with pip, simply use pip::

    pip install --upgrade Mopidy-Scrobbler

To upgrade an extension installed from a Git repo, it's usually enough to pull
the new changes in::

    cd ~/mopidy-dev/mopidy-spotify/
    git pull

Of course, if you have local modifications, you'll need to stash these away on
a branch or similar first.

Depending on the changes to the extension, it may be necessary to update the
metadata about the extension package by installing it in "editable" mode
again::

    pip install --editable .


Contribution workflow
=====================

Before you being, make sure you've read the :ref:`contributing` page and the
guidelines there. This section will focus more on the practical workflow.

For the examples, we're making a change to Mopidy. Approximately the same
workflow should work for most Mopidy extensions too.

.. contents::
   :local:


Setting up Git remotes
----------------------

Assuming we already have a local Git clone of the upstream Git repo in
:file:`~/mopidy-dev/mopidy/`, we can run ``git remote -v`` to list the
configured remotes of the repo::

    $ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (push)

For clarity, we can rename the ``origin`` remote to ``upstream``::

    $ git remote rename origin upstream
    $ git remote -v
    upstream        https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (push)

If you haven't already, `fork the repository
<https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ to your own GitHub account.

Then, add the new fork as a remote to your local clone::

    git remote add myuser git@github.com:myuser/mopidy.git

The end result is that you have both the upstream repo and your own fork as
remotes::

    $ git remote -v
    myuser  git@github.com:myuser/mopidy.git (fetch)
    myuser  git@github.com:myuser/mopidy.git (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy.git (push)


Creating a branch
-----------------

Fetch the latest data from all remotes without affecting your working
directory::

    git remote update --prune

Now, we are ready to create and checkout a new branch off of the upstream
``main`` branch for our work::

    git checkout -b fix-crash-on-foo upstream/main

Do the work, while remembering to adhere to code style, test the changes, make
necessary updates to the documentation, and making small commits with good
commit messages. All as described in :ref:`contributing` and elsewhere in
the :ref:`devenv` guide.


Creating a pull request
-----------------------

When everything is done and committed, push the branch to your fork on GitHub::

    git push myuser fix-crash-on-foo

Go to the repository on GitHub where you want the change merged, in this case
https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy, and `create a pull request
<https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_.


Updating a pull request
-----------------------

When the pull request is created, our CI setup will run all tests on it.
If something fails, you'll usually get a notification from GitHub.
You might as well just fix the issues right away,
as we won't merge a pull request without all CI builds being green.
See :ref:`running-tests` on how to run the same tests locally as
our CI setup runs on your pull request.

When you've fixed the issues, you can update the pull request simply by pushing
more commits to the same branch in your fork::

    git push myuser fix-crash-on-foo

Likewise, when you get review comments from other developers on your pull
request, you're expected to create additional commits which addresses the
comments. Push them to your branch so that the pull request is updated.
