## Publish a new release

1. In a Pull Request, update the version number in [`./src/solidago/__version__.py`](./src/solidago/__version__.py)
2. The package will be published automatically when the new version is merged into "main", by [this Github Action](../.github/workflows/solidago-publish.yml).

## Tests

To run tests, setup a virtual environment, activate it, install dependencies and run pytest.
```
python3 -m venv devenv
source devenv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```
Depending on the platform, you may need to replace ```source devenv/bin/activate``` by another call.
See the [venv doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) for more information.

## Synthetic experiments

To run experiments, once the virtual environement setup, you may run the experiments on synthetic data using.
```
python3 experiments/synthetic.py experiments/resilience.json
python3 experiments/synthetic.py experiments/engagement_bias.json
```
The results will be exported in ```experiments/results```.
You may modify the experiments by editing ```experiments/resilience.json```, 
or by creating a new ```.json``` file.
