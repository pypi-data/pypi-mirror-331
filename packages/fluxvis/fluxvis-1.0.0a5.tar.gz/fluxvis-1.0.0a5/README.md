When a fluxengine-style CSV file with decoder information is supplied, the interpretation of each portion of the disk is shown:

 * Blue: metadata
 * Green: successfully decoded data
 * Red: data could not be decoded

# Usage (via google colab)
 * Visit https://colab.research.google.com/github/adafruit/fluxvis/blob/main/fluxvis.ipynb
 * Follow the on-screen instructions.

# Usage (local)
 * `pip install fluxvis`

 * Get your flux in a greaseweazle-compatible format such as `.scp` or in the ".a2r" format.

 * Use a commandline like
   ```
   python -mfluxvis --tracks 35 --diameter 108 --stride 2 write dos33.scp dos33.png
   ```
   or
   ```
   python -mfluxvis --tracks 35 --diameter 108 --stride 2 show dos33.scp
   ```

Flux reading is done via embedded copies of
[greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) and
[a2rchery](https://github.com/a2-4am/a2rchery).  Thanks to @keirf and @a2-4am
