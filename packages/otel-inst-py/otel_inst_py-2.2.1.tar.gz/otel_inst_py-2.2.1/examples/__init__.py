"""
This module contains examples for tracing.

See the individual scripts for more information.

**NOTE:** Some of the examples needs external services e.g. Jaeger, OTEL collector,
so start the [`docker-compose.test.yml`](../docker-compose.test.yml) in the project root folder before using the examples:

```bash
docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.test.yml up
```
