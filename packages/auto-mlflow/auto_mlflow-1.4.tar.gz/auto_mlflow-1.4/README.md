## üì¶ **Auto MLFlow**

## üîπ **Overview**
Auto MLFlow is an open-source automated MLOps library for MLFlow in Python. It simplifies the logging and tracking of machine learning experiments by providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for interacting with MLFlow servers. 

With Auto MLFlow, you can:
- Automatically log experiment parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models.
- Store images, textual data, and logs in MLFlow without additional configuration.
- Seamlessly integrate with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Simplify MLOps workflows by reducing manual logging efforts.
- Maintain reproducibility and transparency in ML experiments.

## üîÑ **Example Usage**
- Start a MLFlow Server.
  ```  
  mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555
  ```
- Use Auto MLFlow to log model and experiment related information.
  ```python
  import auto_mlflow
  user_name = "Ravin Kumar"
  project_name = "Object Detection"
  experiment_name = "Using Yolo approach"
  runName = "using yolov3"
  total_epochs = 30
  mlflow_server_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:5555" # IP address of the MLFlow Server.
  
  # initialisation 
  auto_mlflow.init_run(user_name, project_name, experiment_name, runName, mlflow_server_uri) # project, experiment, and run is created
  
  # below this line, whatever is printed in the terminal will also get logged in the MLFlow inside the file log.txt
  auto_mlflow.write_param(param_dict={"learning_rate": "0.001", "total_epochs": str(total_epochs)}) # save training related information
  
  # storing train, val, and test loss values
  model_architecture = get_model_architecture()
  for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    train_loss = ...
    valid_loss = ...
    test_loss = ...
    metric_dict={"train_loss": train_loss, "valid_loss": valid_loss, "test_loss": test_loss}
    auto_mlflow.write_metric(metric_dict, step = epoch)
  
  # storing an image in MLFlow Server
  numpy_array_bgr = visualised_image(.....)
  auto_mlflow.write_image(numpy_array_bgr, image_name="image.jpg")
  
  # storing text in a file inside MLFlow Server
  auto_mlflow.write_text(filename="additional_file.txt", filedata="object detection model")
  
  # storing already existing local file inside MLFlow Server
  # example- incase one wants to save only weights, and not rely on model registry. This will get saved inside weights/ in MLFlow Sever
  auto_mlflow.write_files("yolo_weights.pth", filepath="weights")
  
  # storing an entire directory present in local system, to the MLFlow Server
  auto_mlflow.write_directory("./other_data", mlflow_dir_path="artifacts") # this will copy all the content of ./other_data to MLFlow inside artifacts/
  
  # Logging a model
  auto_mlflow.log_model(model_architecture, model_run_path="models") # the logged model can be used for model registry
  
  auto_mlflow.end_run() # all the information is successfully saved.
  # complete 
  ```
