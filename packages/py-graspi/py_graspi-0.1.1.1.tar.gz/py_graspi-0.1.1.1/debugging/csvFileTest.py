    """
    Measures and records the time and memory usage of graph creation, filtering, and pathfinding.

    This function benchmarks the following operations:
    1. Creates a lattice graph.
    2. Filters the graph.
    3. Finds the shortest paths using BFS on the filtered graph.
    Each operation is repeated 5 times, and the average time is recorded.
    Additionally, the memory usage for all operations is measured.

    Args:
        txt (str): The file path to the graph specification used for the lattice generation.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the following metrics:
            - Average creation time (seconds)
            - Average filtering time (seconds)
            - Average BFS time (seconds)
            - Overall runtime (seconds)
            - Total memory usage (bytes)
