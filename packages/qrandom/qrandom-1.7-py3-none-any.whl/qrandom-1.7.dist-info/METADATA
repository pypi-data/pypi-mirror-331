## 🚀 **Usage Guide**

### 🎲 **Random Selection Using a Quantum Circuit**

Generate a quantum circuit for 'N' participants:

```python
import qrandom
res = qrandom.select(8)  # 8 represents the total number of participants.
```

### 🖼 **Visualizing the Quantum Circuit**

Save the pictorial representation of the quantum circuit:

```python
import qrandom
qrandom.vis_circuit(8, "file_name.png")  # Saves the circuit diagram for 8 participants as file_name.png
```
