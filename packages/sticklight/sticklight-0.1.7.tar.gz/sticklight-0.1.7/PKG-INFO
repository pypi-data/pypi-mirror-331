# Sticklight Python SDK

The official Python SDK for [Sticklight](https://sticklight.io).

## Installation

```sh
pip install sticklight
# OR
uv add sticklight
```

## Quick Start

```python
import sticklight as sl

# Authenticate with your API key
sl.init("your-api-key")

# Publish an event
sl.capture(
    "user_sent_message",
    user_id="user_123",
    message="I need help with your new feature",
    #  ... Any other data you want to track
)
```

## Authentication

You'll need a Sticklight API key to use this SDK. You can either:

1. Set it as an environment variable:
   ```sh
   export STICKLIGHT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. Use `init` to authenticate at the start of your application:
   ```python
   sl.init("your-api-key")
   ```

To get your API key, go to the [Sticklight Platform] and create a new key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
