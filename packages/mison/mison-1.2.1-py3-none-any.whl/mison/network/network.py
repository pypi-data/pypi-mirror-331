        Construct a mapping of developers committing to files.

        This function generates a NetworkX graph (`DevFileMapping`) that represents the relationship between
        developers and the files they have modified. The resulting graph consists of two types of nodes:

        - **Developers** (`type="dev"`)
        - **Files** (`type="file"`)

        Edges between developers and files indicate that a developer has modified a particular file in at least
        one commit. Each edge includes a `"commits"` attribute, which is a list of `mison.miner.Commit` objects
        representing the commits where the developer changed the file.

        ### Graph Properties:
        - **Nodes**: Each node has a `"type"` attribute set to either `"dev"` (developer) or `"file"` (file).
        - **Edges**: An edge exists between a developer and a file if the developer has modified that file.
          The `"commits"` attribute on the edge contains the list of related commits.

        Map renamed files in a `DevFileMapping` graph to their latest filenames.

        This function updates a `DevFileMapping` graph by tracking file renames across commits and
        ensuring that all references to old filenames are mapped to their latest version.

        ### How It Works:
        - Resolve each file's latest name by scanning the commit history for file renames
            (`ModificationType.RENAME`) and records rename chains.
        - Updates the graph:
          - If an old filename has a newer version, it is **replaced** with the latest filename.
          - Merge edges from the old file node to the new file node while preserving commit data.
          - Store the list of old filenames under the `"old_paths"` attribute of the latest filename.

        ### Graph Updates:
        - **Nodes**: Old filenames are removed, and their data is merged into the latest filename node.
        - **Edges**: Developers previously linked to an old filename are reconnected to the latest filename.
        - **Attributes**: Each latest filename node retains a list of `"old_paths"` for traceability.
