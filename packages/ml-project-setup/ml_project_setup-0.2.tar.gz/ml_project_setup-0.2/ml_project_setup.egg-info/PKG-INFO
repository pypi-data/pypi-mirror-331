*A simple package for setting up a structured Machine Learning project.*

## 📖 Overview  
`ml_project_setup` helps you quickly set up a standardized Machine Learning project structure with best practices.

## 📂 Project Structure Created  
After running `mlsetup my_project`, the following structure is created:

```
my_project/
│── source/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── entity/
│   ├── pipeline/
│   ├── utility/
│   ├── exception/
│   ├── logger/
│── .gitignore
│── README.md
│── requirements.txt
│── main.py
│── setup.py
```

## 🛠 Installation
