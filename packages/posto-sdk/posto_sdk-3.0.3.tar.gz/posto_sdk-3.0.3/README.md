The Posto SDK makes it easy to schedule and post your content on social media networks through a simple Python or Javascript API. You can post messages immediately or schedule them for later, attach media files (images, videos), and much more.

This can be used by brands and agencies to schedule posts for multiple social media networks from a single place.

Or allow the age of agentic social media management, where AI agents can schedule and post content on social media networks autonomously.
