# ✨ Welcome to CosmoTalker - Your Gateway to the Cosmos!

🚀 **CosmoTalker v1.1.1** is here! Explore space and science effortlessly using this offline Python library.

## 🌠 About CosmoTalker

Developed by **Bhuvanesh M**, CosmoTalker is a Python library designed to bring knowledge of celestial bodies, scientific phenomena, and space-related information directly to your system—no internet required!

## ✨ Features:

✅ Get detailed information about celestial bodies within the **Solar System** 🌍☀️\
✅ Learn about various scientific phenomena 🔬\
✅ Ask space and science-related questions for insightful responses 🧑‍🔬\
✅ Works **offline** with the new Python module 🖥️🚀\
✅ Optional **online** features for enhanced exploration 🌌

🔭 **Note:** CosmoTalker v1.0 focuses on the **Solar System**. Future updates will expand its capabilities to explore galaxies and beyond! ✨

## 🌍 Contribute to a Greener Planet!

The 'Search on Web' feature, available at bhuvaneshm.in/cosmotalker and as the `search(str)` function in the Python library (since v1.1.1), supports global reforestation 🌱💚. Powered by Ecosia, every search helps plant trees and create a greener Earth 🌳. This function requires a string input and performs an online search.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### Installation:

```sh
pip install cosmotalker
```

### Basic Usage:

```python
import cosmotalker as ct

# Retrieve information about a celestial body
earth_info = ct.get("earth")
print(earth_info)  # Offline function

# Online Features
print(ct.apod())        # Fetch Astronomy Picture of the Day
print(ct.celestrak())   # Get satellite tracking data
print(ct.search("words"))  # Eco-friendly web search with Ecosia
print(ct.search("yt"))  # Opens YouTube
```

📌 **Note:** If a name has multiple words, use a hyphen (-) instead of spaces (e.g., `get("planet-x")`). In `ct.search()`, you can use shortcuts like `wa` for WhatsApp, `fb` for Facebook, `insta` for Instagram, `gpt` for ChatGPT, etc., or provide a query to perform an online search.
