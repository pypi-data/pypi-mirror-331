               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

|osc-climate-project| |osc-climate-slack| |osc-climate-github| |pypi| |build-status| |pdm| |PyScaffold|

***********************************
OS-Climate Data Extraction Tool
***********************************

This project provides a CLI tool and Python scripts to train Transformer models (via Hugging Face) for two primary tasks:  
1. **Relevance Detection**: Determines if a question-context pair is relevant.  
2. **KPI Detection**: Fine-tunes models to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) from datasets like annual reports and perform inference.

Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the tool, use pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install osc-transformer-based-extractor

After installation, you can access the CLI tool with:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor

This command will show the available commands and help via Typer, our CLI library.

Commands and Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Relevance Detection
--------------------------

**Fine-tuning the Model:**

Assume your project structure looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    │
    ├── kpi_mapping.csv
    ├── training_data.csv
    ├── data/              
    │   └── (JSON files for inference)
    ├── model/             
    │   └── (Model-related files)
    ├── saved__model/      
    │   └── (Output from training)
    ├── output/            
    │   └── (Results from inference)

Use the following command to fine-tune the model:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor relevance-detector fine-tune \
      --data_path "project/training_data.csv" \
      --model_name "bert-base-uncased" \
      --num_labels 2 \
      --max_length 128 \
      --epochs 3 \
      --batch_size 16 \
      --output_dir "project/saved__model/" \
      --save_steps 500

**Running Inference:**

.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor relevance-detector perform-inference \
      --folder_path "project/data/" \
      --kpi_mapping_path "project/kpi_mapping.csv" \
      --output_path "project/output/" \
      --model_path "project/model/" \
      --tokenizer_path "project/model/" \
      --threshold 0.5

2. KPI Detection
---------------------

The KPI detection functionality includes **fine-tuning** and **inference**.

**Fine-tuning the KPI Model:**

Assume your project structure looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    │
    ├── kpi_mapping.csv              
    ├── training_data.csv             
    │
    ├── model/                        
    │   └── (model-related files, e.g., tokenizer, config, checkpoints)
    │
    ├── saved__model/                 
    │   └── (Folder to store output from fine-tuning)
    │
    ├── output/                     
    │   └── (output files, e.g., inference_results.xlsx)


.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor kpi-detection fine-tune \
        --data_path "project/training_data.csv" \
        --model_name "bert-base-uncased" \
        --max_length 128 \
        --epochs 3 \
        --batch_size 16 \
        --learning_rate 5e-5 \
        --output_dir "project/saved__model/" \
        --save_steps 500


**Performing Inference:**

.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor kpi-detection inference \
        --data_file_path "project/data/input_dataset.csv" \
        --output_path "project/output/inference_results.xlsx" \
        --model_path "project/model/"

We use **pdm** for package management and **tox** for testing.

1. Install ``pdm``:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pip install pdm

2. Sync dependencies:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pdm sync

3. Add new packages (e.g., numpy):

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pdm add numpy

4. Run ``tox`` for linting and testing:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ pip install tox
      $ tox -e lint
      $ tox -e test
