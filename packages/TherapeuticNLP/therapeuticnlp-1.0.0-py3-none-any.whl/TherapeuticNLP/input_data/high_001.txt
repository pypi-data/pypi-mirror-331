T	hey Monica how are you doing today. [Duration:40]
C	I'm okay right now but I'm a little anxious because thinking about how Black Friday is soon and my friends want to go to the mall for Black Friday but I really can't go and I want to go but I really to interesting. [Duration:40]
T	so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it. [Duration:40]
C	yeah Monaco but interesting but I was thinking about it and maybe if I could make an image or something that I could use while I'm there maybe I'd be able to go so I was wondering if I could give you that very well. [Duration:40]
T	that sounds like a great idea can absolutely do that. [Duration:40]
C	okay. [Duration:40]
T	so we have some materials on the table but if you'd like to use anything else that we've used previously just let me know and I'll get them to you for you. [Duration:40]
C	um do you have a Sharpie. [Duration:40]
T	it do did you have a color that you wanted. [Duration:40]
C	black maybe. [Duration:40]
T	all right here. [Duration:40]
C	this. [Duration:40]
T	welcome. [Duration:40]
C	ok I think I'm done. [Duration:40]
T	all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it. [Duration:40]
C	well I'm sure um I drew mountains and lake because when I think about things like Unicom I think of nature so I drew a scene that I think would keep me calm. [Duration:40]
T	so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny. [Duration:40]
C	yes as long as I can remember to think about this image when I'm there but maybe I'll bring it with me when I go so I can refer to it when I'm anxious. [Duration:40]
T	that sounds like a great idea. [Duration:40]
