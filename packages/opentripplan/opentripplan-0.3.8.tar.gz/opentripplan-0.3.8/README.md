## Description

Open Trip Plan is a GUI application for trip planning, providing an intuitive user interface for organizing travel visits efficiently. Open Trip Plan allows to plan a trip by adding markers on a map (based on OpenStreetMap) associated with a note.

Open Trip Plan is developed and daily tested on Linux. It should work on any platform. It has already been tested on MacOS.

Open Trip Plan is already usable but would be better with a lot of other features. Some wanted features are listed [here](https://github.com/kleag/opentripplan/issues). Don't hesitate to create a new issue if you think at other features. And contribute them if you can!

### Current features:

* Display OpenStreetMap map
* Zoom and pan the map
* Adding location markers on the map
* List existing location on the left part of the GUI
* Associate a note to a location. The first line of the note is used as the title in the list
* Search location by name, and add a new marker when selecting an entry in the list
* Delete markers
* Open and save local files
* Open and save files on any Nextcloud server you have access to
* Note text formatting (heading, bold, â€¦)
* Image insertion (copy paste only currently)

## Installation

### For users familiar with Python

Open Trip Plan is on PyPi. To install it, run:

```sh
uv venv opentripplan
source opentripplan/bin/activate
```

Then install OpenTripPlan and run it:

```sh
uv pip install opentripplan
opentripplan
```

## Usage

To launch the application:
```bash
opentripplan
```
