        Retrieve Feature Effects for the model.

        Feature Effects provides partial dependence and predicted vs actual values for top-500
        features ordered by feature impact score.

        The partial dependence shows marginal effect of a feature on the target variable after
        accounting for the average effects of all other predictive features. It indicates how,
        holding all other variables except the feature of interest as they were,
        the value of this feature affects your prediction.

        Requires that Feature Effects has already been computed with
        :meth:`request_feature_effect <datarobot.models.Model.request_feature_effect>`.

        See :meth:`get_feature_effect_metadata <datarobot.models.Model.get_feature_effect_metadata>`
        for retrieving information the available sources.

        source : str
            The source Feature Effects are retrieved for.

           The feature effects data.

        Raises
        ------
