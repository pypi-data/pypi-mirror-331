              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# SuricataLog

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/suricatalog)](https://pepy.tech/project/suricatalog)

When I started learning how to use [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) quickly found that I needed a tool to inspect the eve.json file; Most of the tutorials 
and documentation out there suggested installing a stack to do the following tasks:
1. Store the logs in a central location
2. Normalize and enrich the events, specially alerts
3. Use a frontend to dive into the data

Which is very useful, but what if I just needed to do a quick inspection of the events?

Sooner or later you will get [bored to death](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/output/eve/eve-json-examplesjq.html) doing this:

```shell
cat eve.json | jq -r -c 'select(.event_type=="alert")|.payload'| base64 --decode
```

SuricataLog is a set of tools/ scripts to parse and display Suricata log files (like /var/log/suricata/eve.json)

The [Eve JSON format](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/output/eve/eve-json-format.html) is not very complex, 
so I wrote few scripts with the features I tough would be more useful for my home network analysis.

As a bonus, I wrote my learning experience as a [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) that you can use to learn about Suricata and also how to test it.

## Installing from PIP

Before you do anything else, make sure your environment is good to go:

```shell
python3 -m venv ~/virtualenv/suricatalog
. ~/virtualenv/suricatalog/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### Installing from Pypi.org

```shell
pip3 install --upgrade SuricataLog
```

### Installing from source

```shell
git clone git@github.com:josevnz/SuricataLog.git
cd SuricataLog
python3 -m venv ~/virtualenv/suricatalog
. ~/virtualenv/suricatalog/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
pip3 install dist/SuricataLog-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Developer installation

So you want to contribute? Or found a bug and think you can submit a patch? Nice! Here is what you can dd to run on development mode:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:josevnz/SuricataLog.git
cd SuricataLog
python3 -m venv ~/virtualenv/suricatalog
. ~/virtualenv/suricatalog/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade build
pip install textual-dev
pip install --editable .
```

Running unit tests is very easy after that:
```shell
(SuricataLog) [josevnz@dmaf5 SuricataLog]$ python -m unittest test/*.py
.........
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 9 tests in 0.334s

OK
```

If the unit tests fails, then this is most likely the first place to fix a problem.

I do recommend also running the textualize console and watch for the console messages:

```shell
textual console
```

Then on another terminal:

```shell
textual run --dev --command eve_log --timestamp '2015-01-01 10:41:21.642899' --formats TABLE test/eve.json
```

### Creating a Docker image

Please check [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for more details.

## Running the scripts

Once everything is installed in  your virtual environment you should be able to call the scripts

### Simple EVE log parser

Better see it by yourself (remember, use --help to learn what options are supported)

#### Table format:

![suricatalog-eve_log-table.png](suricatalog-eve_log-table.png)

````shell
eve_log --timestamp '2015-01-01 10:41:21.642899' --formats TABLE test/eve.json
````

### Canned reports with eve_json.py

```shell
(suricatalog) [josevnz@dmaf5 SuricataLog]$ eve_json --help
usage: eve_json [-h] [--nxdomain | --payload | --flow | --netflow NETFLOW | --useragent] eve [eve ...]

This script is inspired by the examples provided on [15.1.3. Eve JSON ‘jq’ Examples](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/output/eve/eve-json-
examplesjq.html) A few things: * The output uses colorized JSON

positional arguments:
  eve                Path to one or more /var/log/suricata/eve.json file to parse.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --nxdomain         Show DNS records with NXDOMAIN
  --payload          Show alerts with a printable payload
  --flow             Aggregated flow report per protocol and destination port
  --netflow NETFLOW  Get the netflow for a given IP address
  --useragent        Top user agent in HTTP traffic
```

Take a look at some examples below:

#### NXDOMAIN

![suricatalog-eve_json-nxdomain.png](suricatalog-eve_json-nxdomain.png)

```shell
eve_json --nxdomain test/eve.json
```

#### PAYLOAD

![suricatalog-eve_json-payload.png](suricatalog-eve_json-payload.png)

```shell
eve_json --payload ~/Downloads/eve.json
```

#### FLOW

![suricatalog_eve_json-flow.png](suricatalog_eve_json-flow.png)

```shell
eve_json --flow test/eve_udp_flow.json
```

#### NETFLOW

![suricatalog_eve_json-netflow.png](suricatalog_eve_json-netflow.png)

```shell
eve_json --netflow 224.0.0.251 test/eve_udp_flow.json
```

#### USERAGENT

![suricatalog-eve_json-useragent.png](suricatalog-eve_json-useragent.png)

```shell
eve_json --useragent test/eve.json
```

### Running eve_* applications on a browser

![Suricata eve server, running eve* applications on a browser!](suricata_eve_server.png)

You can run Suricata Log applications on a browser by using the `eve_server` wrapper:

```shell
# Show the flow report on a eve.json file
eve_server --application eve_json -- --flow ~/eve.json

# Show NX domain report
eve_server --application eve_json -- --nxdomain ~/eve.json

# Inspect the eve.json records
eve_server --applications eve_log -- ~/eve.json
```

You need to pass the '--' to tell the server than this options belong to the underlying eve_* you want to call.

## Running from Docker

It is also possible to run SuricataLog from a Docker container. Please see the [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for more details

## Running with uv

If you have uv, you can just do this:

```shell
uvx --from SuricataLog eve_log /var/log/suricata/eve.json
uvx --from SuricataLog eve_json --useragent /var/log/suricata/eve.json
uvx --from SuricataLog eve_server --application eve_json -- --flow /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

## Supported versions

I work on this project on **my spare time** and I cannot support every version of Linux/ Python combination out there.
This is my current test bed, and it may change without further notice

| SuricataLog | Supported | OS                               | Python    | Suricata |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------|----------|
