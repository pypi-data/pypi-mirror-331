## Python Dynamical System Scaling Analysis

This Python package will provides methods for Dynamical System Scaling (DSS) analysis for simple single agent of change cases. I would heavily reccommend the user read theory regarding DSS and scaling for Verification and Validation (V&V). https://glc.ans.org/nureth-16/data/papers/13129.pdf 

A a short DSS refresher and application of the theory is provided in the documentation website. https://granthendrickson19.github.io/Python-DSS-Analysis/index.html
