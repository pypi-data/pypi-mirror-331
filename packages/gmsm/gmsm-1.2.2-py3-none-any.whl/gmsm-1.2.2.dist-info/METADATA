# GMSM: Cryptographic Library  

GMSM provides essential cryptographic functionalities, including:  

## SM2 - Chinese National Elliptic Curve Cryptography  
A secure elliptic curve algorithm for encryption, digital signatures, and key exchange.  

## SM3 - Chinese National Hash Algorithm  
A high-security hash function designed for data integrity and authentication.  

## SM4 - Chinese National Block Cipher  
A symmetric encryption algorithm optimized for secure communication.  

## Additional Encryption Support  
**MD5** - A widely used hashing algorithm for checksums and digital signatures.  
**AES (CBC/ECB)** - Advanced Encryption Standard with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Electronic Codebook (ECB) modes.
