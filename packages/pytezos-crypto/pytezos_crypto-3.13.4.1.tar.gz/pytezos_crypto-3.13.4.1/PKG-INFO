# pytezos-crypto

This is a friendly fork of the `crypto` module from the [pytezos](https://github.com/baking-bad/pytezos) project, containing only the cryptographic utilities from the upstream repository, located at [pytezos/crypto](https://github.com/baking-bad/pytezos/tree/master/src/pytezos/crypto).

## Motivation

The purpose of this fork is to provide the cryptographic functionalities of `pytezos` while keeping dependencies to a minimum. The upstream project includes a large number of additional dependencies such as Jupyter Notebook which are unnecessary for those seeking only the cryptographic utilities. This fork extracts the core `crypto` functionality and eliminates non-essential dependencies.

## Approach

This project is not intended to diverge from the upstream. Please submit all proposed changes to the upstream project first, and only open Pull Requests here after those changes have been accepted upstream.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pytezos-crypto
```

## Dependencies

This fork only includes the essential cryptographic dependencies:

- `base58`
- `mnemonic`
- `libnacl`
- `coincurve`
- `fastecdsa`

The [upstream pytezos project](https://github.com/baking-bad/pytezos) has a much broader set of dependencies, supporting a variety of additional features beyond cryptography, including container management, CLI tools, and notebook integrations.

## Usage

For usage details, refer to the [original pytezos documentation](https://github.com/baking-bad/pytezos). This fork maintains API compatibility for the `crypto` module while streamlining dependencies.

## License

This project follows the same MIT license as the original `pytezos` project. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
