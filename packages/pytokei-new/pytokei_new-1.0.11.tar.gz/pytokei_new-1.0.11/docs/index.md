# pytokei
Pytokei is a python binding to [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), from their repo:

---

<p align="center">
Tokei is a program that displays statistics about your code. Tokei will show the number of files, total lines within those files and code, comments, and blanks grouped by language.
</p>

--- 

This wrapper allows to obtain the same reports directly from python.

For more information about `tokei`, please visit its [repo](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pytokei
```

Requires Python >= 3.7.

Binaries are available for:

* **Linux**: `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `i686`, `armv7l`, `musl-x86_64` & `musl-aarch64`
* **MacOS**: `x86_64` & `arm64` (except python 3.7)
* **Windows**: `amd64` & `win32`

Otherwise, you can install from source which requires Rust stable to be installed.

To use the CLI, install with the needed dependencies (maybe with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)).

```bash
pipx install pytokei[cli]
```

## Development

You will need:

- [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/installation.html) to compile the library

- `maturin develop` / `make develop` to compile the code.

From python side:

Run `make install-dev` inside a virtual environment, `make test`, `make mypy` and `make format` to ensure everything is as expected, and `make docs` to build the documentation.

*There are some problems when building the docs with mkdocstrings, a reminder is in the following [github issue](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/issues/404). For the moment, it seems that the best option is to remove the .so file and build the docs without it.*

## Time comparison `tokei` and `pytokei`

Just to see if the binding makes the code slower, a test was done against the [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) repository.

*The timing isn't directly comparable, Rust's version prints the average time, while Python's version shows the minimum, but it should be enough to get an idea. A better test should be defined in the future.*

The python version uses `docker`. A print like the following should appear:

```bash
$ sh run_dockerfile_py.sh

==================
Timing python run:
------------------
100 loops, best of 1: 194 msec per loop
==================
```

The rust version needs [rust-script](https://rust-script.org/) installed.

```bash
$ sh bench_rs.sh
