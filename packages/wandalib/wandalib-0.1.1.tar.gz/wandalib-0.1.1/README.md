# Wandalib  

**Wandalib** is a high-level library built on top of the **WANDA** API (developed by Deltares). Its development is driven by the internal needs and tools used in **IDOM‚Äôs** Water Department, focusing on steady-state and, primarily, transient analysis.  

This library aims to simplify and optimize the use of **WANDA**, providing high-level functions that facilitate data retrieval, visualization, and analysis.  

Contributions, ideas, and bug reports are welcome.  

## üöÄ Roadmap  

- Add high-level functions to extract data, generate plots, and perform analysis focusing solely on pipelines.  
- Integrate **UV** and improve the package structure.  
- Serve as the foundation for the [**wandascenarios**](https://github.com/JuanGuerrero09/wandascenarios) tool.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Execution  

The library uses **UV**, an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in **Rust**, offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to tools like Anaconda (which requires an enterprise license).  

To run and verify the installation:  

```bash
uv run test/test.py
```
