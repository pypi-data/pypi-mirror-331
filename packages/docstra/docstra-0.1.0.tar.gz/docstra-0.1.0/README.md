# Docstra: LLM-Powered Software Documentation Generator & Chatbot

**Docstra** is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate in-depth, contextual documentation for code repositories. Using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB**, Docstra can analyze and link together various elements in a codebase, creating searchable, organized, and meaningful documentation that enhances the developer experience.

This project is a component of a master’s thesis at the **University of Oslo**, exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in improving software documentation processes.

## Key Features

- **Automated Documentation**: Scans and indexes code repositories to generate rich documentation with logical links between files, functions, classes, and modules.
- **Multi-Platform Accessibility**: Available as a local CLI and a FastAPI server, allowing integration into other applications.
- **VSCode and IntelliJ Plugin Support**: In development to enable seamless access within popular IDEs.
- **Electron-based GUI Companion App**: A cross-platform desktop application to view and interact with generated documentation.
- **LLM-Powered Chatbot**: Provides an interactive way to query the codebase and explore documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Poetry** for dependency management. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- **OpenAI API Key** for access to LLM features (set up as an environment variable)

### Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies via Poetry.

```bash
git clone https://github.uio.no/docstra/docstra.git
cd docstra
poetry install
```

### Environment Variables and Project Files

Docstra is designed to integrate smoothly into your existing project environment. When run from within an active repository, Docstra creates a dedicated `.docstra` folder in the root directory to store all generated embeddings and essential project files, keeping your documentation assets organized and easily accessible. This `.docstra` folder also houses a `.env` file for environment variables, including the required OpenAI API key. If the user has not yet added an API key, Docstra will prompt for one when the tool is run; the key can also be provided as a command-line argument. Once entered, the key is securely stored in `.docstra/.env`, allowing for streamlined future usage without additional prompts.

The `.env` file in the `.docstra` folder is automatically loaded when Docstra starts, making it the primary location for environment variables like API keys. This ensures your sensitive credentials are kept separate from your code and configuration.

### Running Docstra

Docstra offers both CLI and FastAPI server options.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Run Docstra directly from the command line:

```bash
poetry run docstra --help
```

Example of generating documentation:

```bash
poetry run docstra generate-docs path/to/your/codebase
```

#### FastAPI Server

To access Docstra as an API service, start the FastAPI server:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn docstra.server:app --reload
```

Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI).

## Usage

Docstra can process entire repositories or selected folders and files. It will extract structured metadata for each code component, allowing cross-referenced links for easy navigation and searchability.

### Querying Documentation

The CLI offers a `query` command, allowing for specific questions about the codebase:

```bash
poetry run docstra query "How does authentication work?"
```

With the FastAPI server, you can send `POST` requests to `/query` with your question in the payload for direct querying from other applications.

## Plugin and GUI Support

- **VSCode and IntelliJ Plugins** (in development): Access Docstra documentation within the editor for a seamless development experience.
- **Electron-based Desktop App** (coming soon): A graphical interface for non-technical users to explore codebase documentation.

### Roadmap

- Integrate interactive LLM-based chatbot for conversational documentation
- Expand plugin support for major IDEs
- Develop Electron-based desktop application
