Masterpiece Plugin
==================

`masterpiece_plugin` is a simple demonstration plugin designed to extend `masterpiece` applications by adding a
basic "Hello, World!" greeting feature. While this plugin is straightforward in its functionality, it serves as a
starting point for developers looking to implement real plugins for `masterpiece`.

Consult the `Masterpiece project <https://gitlab.com/juham/masterpiece>`_ for more information.


Features
--------

The plugin adds one HelloWorld object named 'Hello World - A Plugin' into any masterpiece application that
allows its structure to be expanded. 

The primary purpose of `masterpiece_plugin` is educational. It is intended to demonstrate the fundamental steps
involved in creating and integrating plugins with `masterpiece`. Developers can use this as a reference or template
when building more complex plugins for real-world applications.


Installation

To install:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install masterpiece-plugin


Usage
-----

Once installed, the plugin integrates into the 'masterpiece/examples/myapp.py' application:
