# Jupyter Kernel Client (via WebSocket and HTTP)

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-kernel-client/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyter-kernel-client)](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-kernel-client)

Jupyter Kernel Client allows you to connect via WebSocket and HTTP to Jupyter Kernels. It also provide a easy to use interactive Konsole (console for **K**ernels).

To install the library, run the following command.

```sh
pip install jupyter_kernel_client
```

## Usage

Check you have a Jupyter Server with ipykernel running somewhere. You can install those packages using:

```sh
pip install jupyter-server ipykernel
```

### Kernel Client

1. Start a Jupyter Server.

```sh
jupyter server --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN
```

2. Launch `python` in a terminal and execute the following snippet (update the server_url and token).

```py
import os

from platform import node
from jupyter_kernel_client import KernelClient


with KernelClient(server_url="http://localhost:8888", token="MY_TOKEN") as kernel:
    reply = kernel.execute(
        """import os
from platform import node
print(f"Hey {os.environ.get('USER', 'John Smith')} from {node()}.")
"""
    )
    assert reply["execution_count"] == 1
    assert reply["outputs"] == [
        {
            "output_type": "stream",
            "name": "stdout",
            "text": f"Hey {os.environ.get('USER', 'John Smith')} from {node()}.\n",
        }
    ]
    assert reply["status"] == "ok"
```

### Jupyter Konsole (aka Console for Kernels)

This package can be used to open a Jupyter Console to a Jupyter Kernel üê£.

1. Install the optional dependencies.

```sh
pip install jupyter-kernel-client[konsole]
```

2. Start a Jupyter Server.

```sh
jupyter server --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN
```

3. Start the konsole and execute code.

```sh
jupyter konsole --url http://localhost:8888 --token MY_TOKEN
```

```sh
[KonsoleApp] KernelHttpManager created a new kernel: ...
