// How to use:
// The file is split into sections, each section is used to determine the behaviour of the script.
// The sections are:
// - exclude: files to exclude from the context using regex, one regex per line
// - include: files to include in the context using regex, one regex per line (doesn't work yet)
// - messsage: starting message before the file data, used to help prompt the LLM
//
// Exclude takes precedence over include.
// No section is required, grabit will still run without a .grabit file, this just helps control it.
// Comments are denoted by `//` at the start of a line.
// The message is prepended to the start of the context and is used to guide the LLM.
