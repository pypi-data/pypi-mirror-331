Quasarr connects JDownloader with Radarr and Sonarr. It also decrypts links protected by CAPTCHAs.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/quasarr.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/quasarr)

Quasarr poses as a Newznab Indexer and a SABnzbd client.
It will thus never work in parallel with a real NZB indexer and download client set up.
Torrents are unaffected. To still use NZB indexers, you must set fixed download clients in the advanced indexer
settings for Radarr/Sonarr.

Quasarr includes a solution to quickly and easily decrypt protected links.
[Active Sponsors get access to SponsorsHelper to do so automatically.](https://github.com/users/rix1337/sponsorship)
Alternatively follow the link from the console output (or discord notification) to solve the CAPTCHA manually.
Quasarr will confidently handle the rest.

# Instructions

* Set up at least one hostname for Quasarr to use
    * Chose your own or use the `HOSTNAMES` variable to provide a list of hostnames.
    * Always redact hostnames when creating issues in this repo.
    * Quasarr will become available once at least one suitable hostname is set.
* Provide your [My-JDownloader-Credentials](https://my.jdownloader.org)
* Set up Quasarr as `Newznab Indexer` and `SABnzbd Download Client` in Radarr/Sonarr
    * Use the API key from console output (or copy it from the Quasarr web UI)
    * Leave all other settings at default!
* To see download status messages
  * Open `Activity` → `Queue` → `Options` in Radarr/Sonarr
  * Enable `Release Title`
* To prevent downloads from being removed before processed by Radarr/Sonarr, Quasarr automatically changes some
  JDownloader settings at launch.

# Docker

It is highly recommended to run the latest docker image with all optional variables set.

```
docker run -d \
  --name="Quasarr" \
  -p port:8080 \
  -v /path/to/config/:/config:rw \
  -e 'INTERNAL_ADDRESS'='http://192.168.0.1:8080' \
  -e 'EXTERNAL_ADDRESS'='https://foo.bar/' \
  -e 'DISCORD'='https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/ABCDEFGHIJKLMN' \
  -e 'HOSTNAMES'='https://pastebin.com/raw/eX4Mpl3'
  rix1337/docker-quasarr:latest
  ```

* `INTERNAL_ADDRESS` is required so Radarr/Sonarr can reach Quasarr. **Must** include port!
* `EXTERNAL_ADDRESS` is optional and used in Discord notifications.
* `DISCORD` is optional and must be a valid Discord Webhook URL.
* `HOSTNAMES` is optional and allows skipping the manual hostname step during setup.
    * Must be a publicly available `HTTP` or `HTTPs` link
    * Must be a raw `.ini` / text file (not html or json)
    * Must contain at least one valid Hostname per line `ab = xyz`

# Manual setup

Use this only in case you cant run the docker image.

`pip install `

* Requires Python 3.12 or later

```

  --port=8080
  --discord=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/ABCDEFGHIJKLMN
  --external_address=https://foo.bar/
  --hostnames=https://pastebin.com/raw/eX4Mpl3
  ```

* `--discord` see `DISCORD`docker variable
* `--external_address` see `EXTERNAL_ADDRESS`docker variable
* `--hostnames` see `HOSTNAMES`docker variable

# Roadmap
- Assume there are zero known issues unless you find one or more open issues in this repository.
  - Stability improvements and bugfixes require your help.
  - Report problems by opening a new issue in this repository.
  - Issues must be reproducible and include logs / screenshots.
- The feature set is considered complete. Don't expect feature upgrades.
  - Most feature requests can be satisfied by:
    - Existing settings in  Radarr/Sonarr
    - Existing settings in JDownloader
      - You can set up link filters for undesired mirrors there.
      - The same applies to filtering out offline links.
    - Existing tools from the *arr ecosystem that integrate directly with Radarr/Sonarr
  - There are no hostname integrations in active development.
- Pull requests are welcome. Especially for new and popular hostnames.
  - Always reach out on Discord before starting work on a new feature.
  - Please follow the existing code style and project structure.
  - Please provide proof of functionality (screenshots/examples) when submitting your pull request.
