## Metrics

### Summary Evaluation Metrics

#### Currently Supported Non-LLM Metrics

- **ROUGE Score**: Measures overlap of n-grams between the reference text and generated summary
- **BLEU Score**: Evaluates translation quality by comparing n-gram matches, with custom weights emphasizing unigrams and bigrams
- **BERT Score**: Leverages contextual embeddings to better capture semantic similarity
- **BART Score**: Uses BART's sequence-to-sequence model to evaluate semantic similarity and generation quality

#### Currently Supported LLM Metrics

- **Faithfulness**: Measures factual consistency between summary and source text (requires an LLM provider)
- **Topic Preservation**: Will verify that the most important topics from the source are retained in the summary (requires an LLM provider)
- **Redundancy Detection**: Will identify and flag repeated information within summaries (requires an LLM provider)
- **Conciseness Assessment**: Will evaluate if the summary effectively condenses information without unnecessary verbosity (requires an LLM provider)

### RAG Evaluation Metrics

#### Currently Supported Metrics

- **Answer Attribution**: Evaluates if the answer's claims are properly supported by the provided context
- **Answer Relevance**: Measures how well the answer addresses the specific query intent
- **Completeness**: Evaluates whether the answer addresses all aspects of the query comprehensively
- **Context Relevance**: Assesses how well the retrieved context aligns with and is applicable to the query
- **Faithfulness**: Measures how accurately the answer reflects the information contained in the context without introducing external or contradictory information


### Planned Features


- **Coherence Evaluation**: Will assess the logical flow and readability of the generated summary
- **Style Consistency**: Will evaluate if the summary maintains a consistent writing style and tone
- **Information Density**: Will measure the ratio of meaningful content to length in summaries



## Features

- **Remove Common Stopwords**: Allows for adding custom stopwords to the evaluation process
  - This is useful for removing common words that are often included in summaries but do not contribute to the overall meaning
  - evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, remove_stopwords=True)
- **Custom Stopwords**: Allows for adding custom stopwords to the evaluation process
  - Usage: from assert_llm_tools.utils import add_custom_stopwords
  - Example: add_custom_stopwords(["your", "custom", "stopwords", "here"])
  - remove_stopwords=True must be enabled 
- **Select Summary Metrics**: Allows for selecting which summary evaluation metrics to calculate
  - Usage: evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, metrics=["rouge", "bleu"])
  - Defaults to all metrics if not included
  - Available metrics: ["rouge", "bleu", "bert_score", "bart_score", "faithfulness", "topic_preservation", "redundancy", "conciseness"]
  - Faithfulness, topic preservation, redundancy, and conciseness require an LLM provider via llm_config parameter
- **Select RAG Metrics**: Allows for selecting which RAG evaluation metrics to calculate
  - Usage: evaluate_rag(query, context, answer, metrics=["context_relevance", "answer_accuracy"])
  - Defaults to all metrics if not included
  - Available metrics: ["context_relevance", "answer_accuracy", "context_utilization", "completeness", "faithfulness"]
  - All metrics require an LLM provider via llm_config parameter
- **LLM Provider**: Allows for specifying the LLM provider and model to use for the faithfulness metric
  - Usage: evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, llm_config=LLMConfig(provider="bedrock", model_id="anthropic.claude-v2", region="us-east-1", api_key="your-api-key", api_secret="your-api-secret"))
  - Available providers: ["bedrock", "openai"]
- **Show Progress**: Allows for showing a progress bar during metric calculation
  - Usage: evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, show_progress=True)
  - Defaults to showing progress bar if not included.

## Understanding Scores

### Summary Evaluation Scores

All metrics are normalized to return scores between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better performance:

- ROUGE Score: Higher means better overlap with reference
- BLEU Score: Higher means better translation quality
- BERT Score: Higher means better semantic similarity
  - Note that running BERT score for the first time will require a download of the model weights, which may take a while.
  - Use the `bert_model` parameter to specify the model to use for BERTScore calculation.
  - Default model is "microsoft/deberta-base-mnli". (~500mb download on first use.)
  - Other options is "microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli". (~3gb download on first use.)
- BART Score: Higher means better semantic similarity and generation quality
  - Returns log-likelihood scores normalized to be interpretable, therefore results are likely to be negative. Closer to 0 is better.
  - Calculates bidirectional scores (reference→summary and summary→reference)
  - Uses the BART-large-CNN model by default (~1.6GB download on first use)
- Faithfulness: Higher means better factual consistency
- Topic Preservation: Higher means better retention of key topics
- Redundancy: Higher means less redundant content (1.0 = no redundancy)
- Conciseness: Higher means less verbose content (1.0 = optimal conciseness)

### RAG Evaluation Scores

All RAG metrics return scores between 0 and 1:

- Answer Attribution: Higher means better support from context for answer claims
- Answer Relevance: Higher means better alignment with query intent
- Completeness: Higher means the answer addresses all aspects of the query comprehensively
- Context Relevance: Higher means better match between query and retrieved context
- Faithfulness: Higher means better alignment between the answer and the provided context

## Usage

```python
from assert_llm_tools.core import evaluate_summary, evaluate_rag
from assert_llm_tools.utils import add_custom_stopwords
from assert_llm_tools.llm.config import LLMConfig

# Add custom stopwords
add_custom_stopwords(["this", "artificial", "intelligence"])


# Example text from an article
full_text = """
Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the world economy. Companies 
are investing billions in AI research and development, leading to breakthroughs 
in automation, data analysis, and decision-making processes. While this 
technology offers immense benefits, it also raises concerns about job 
displacement and ethical considerations.
"""

# Example summary
summary = """
AI is transforming the economy through major investments, bringing advances in 
automation and analytics while raising job and ethical concerns.
"""

# Using OpenAI
config = LLMConfig(
    provider="openai",
    model_id="gpt-4",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Summary Evaluation Example
metrics = evaluate_summary(full_text, summary, 
                         remove_stopwords=True, 
                         metrics=["rouge", "bleu", "bert_score", "bart_score", "faithfulness", "topic_preservation", "redundancy", "conciseness"], 
                         llm_config=config)

# RAG Evaluation Example
rag_metrics = evaluate_rag(query="What is the capital of France?",
                          context="Paris is the capital and largest city of France.",
                          answer="The capital of France is Paris.",
                          metrics=["context_relevance", "answer_accuracy", "completeness", "faithfulness","answer_attribution"],
                          llm_config=config)
