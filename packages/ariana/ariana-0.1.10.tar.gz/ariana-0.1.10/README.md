# [Ariana](https://ariana.dev)

Ariana is an IDE extension and CLI tool to debug your JS/TS code in development way faster than with a traditional debugger or `console.log` statements.

**Features:**

- 📑 Overlay **recent execution traces** on top of your code
- 🕵️ Inspect **values taken by expressions** in your code 
- ⏱️ See **how long** it took for any expression in your code to run

## How to use

#### 1) 💾 Install the `ariana` CLI

With npm:

```bash
npm install -g ariana
```

With pip:

```bash
pip install ariana
```

#### 2) ✨ Run supported code as you would from the command line but with the `ariana` command along side it

```bash
ariana <run command>
```

For example, on a Node.js codebase it could be:

```bash
ariana npm run dev
```

#### 3) 👾 In your IDE, get instant debugging information in your code files.

You can install the extension on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dedale-dev.ariana), or by searching for `Ariana` in the extensions tab in VSCode or Cursor.

- Open a code file, press `ctrl + shift + p` and search for the `Ariana: Toggle Traced Expressions Highlighting` command.
- 🗺️ Know which code segments got ran and which didn't
- 🕵️ Inspect the values that were taken by any expression in your code
