[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Druida is an artificial intelligence developed support the metasurfaces design process.

- Generative pipelines for metasurfaces design
The goal is to provide a stable version of the most important algorithmic pipelines to train and deploy AI for metasurfaces design.

## Features

- Deep Neural Network Stack
- GAN Generator Stack
- GAN Discriminator Stack
- Unconditional Diffusion Model
- Conditional Diffusion Model

## Goals
> Configurable AI models
> Easy to interface and use through jupyter notebooks.
> Reproduceable models
> API to future hyperparameters optimization



## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - Python 3.
- [PyTorch] - The framework to build our algorithms.
- [CLIP] - Pipelione to produce word encoding.


## Installation


Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
https://pypi.org/project/druida/

```sh
pip install druida

```
