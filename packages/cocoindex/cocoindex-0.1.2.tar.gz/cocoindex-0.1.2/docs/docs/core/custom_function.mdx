# Build Custom Functions

To build a custom function, you need to define a function spec and an executor.

## Function Spec

The function spec of a function defines the function's parameters.
These parameters configures behavior of a specific instance of the function.
When you use this function in a flow (typically by a [`transform()`](/docs/core/flow_def#transform)), you instantiate this function spec, with specific parameter values.

A function spec is defined as a class that inherits from `cocoindex.op.FunctionSpec`.

```python

class DemoFunctionSpec(cocoindex.op.FunctionSpec):
    """
    Documentation for the function.
    """
    param1: str
    param2: int | None = None
    ...
```

Notes:
*   All fields of the spec must have a type serializable / deserializable by the `json` module.
*   All subclasses of `FunctionSpec` can be instantiated similar to a dataclass, i.e. `ClassName(param1=value1, param2=value2, ...)`.

## Function Executor

A function executor defines behavior of a function. It's initantiated for each operation that uses this function.

The function executor is responsible for:

*   *Prepare* for the function execution, based on the spec. It happens once and only once before execution. e.g. if the function calls a machine learning model, the model name can be a parameter as a field of the spec, and we may load the model in this phase.
*   *Run* the function, for each specific input arguments. This happens multiple times, for each specific rows of data.

A function executor is defined as a class annotated by `@cocoindex.op.executor_class()`.


```python
@cocoindex.op.executor_class()
class DemoFunctionExecutor:
    spec: DemoFunctionSpec
    ...

    def prepare(self) -> None:
        ...

    def __call__(self, input_value: str) -> str:
        ...
```

Notes:

*   The `cocoindex.op.executor_class()` class also takes the following input:
    *   `gpu: bool`: Whether the executor will use GPU. It will affect the way the function is scheduled.
*   A `spec` field must be present in the class, and must be annoated with the spec class name.
*   The `prepare()` method is optional. It's executed once and only once before any `__call__` execution, to prepare the function execution.
*   The `__call__()` method is required. It's executed for each specific rows of data.
    Types of arugments and the return value must be annotated, so that CocoIndex will have information about data types of the operation's output fields. See [Data Types](/docs/core/data_types) for supported types.
