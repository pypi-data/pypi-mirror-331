> WIP: Not quite functional yet.

## Highlights

* Concurrent editing. Continue editing while the assistant runs, without any
  risks of interference.


## Ideas

* Change prompt CLI inputs to `[PROMPT] [--] [ARGS]`. If `PROMPT` does not
  contain any spaces or `ARGS` (or `--`) is present, it will be interpreted as a
  template name. Otherwise an inline prompt.
* Only include files that the bot has written in draft commits.
* Add `--generate` timeout option.
* Add URL and API key to `openai_bot`. Also add a compatibility version which
  does not use threads, so that it can be used with tools only. Gemini only
  supports the latter.
