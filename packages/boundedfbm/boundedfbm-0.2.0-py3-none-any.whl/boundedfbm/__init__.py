"""
Bounded FBM Simulator
=====================

A package for simulating bounded Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM)
within 3D shapes created with PyVista.

This package provides tools for:
- Creating various 3D cell shapes using PyVista
- Simulating FBM with time-varying diffusion coefficients
- Modeling Hurst exponents as a Markov chain
- Handling boundary conditions for accurate confinement

Main Components:
---------------
- Cell creation utilities
- FBM simulation with boundary handling
- Markov chain state transitions
- Parameter validation
