  abstract = {Recently it was reported that the pharmacokinetics of propofol are modified by changes in cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cardiac output and other factors on the hypnotic dose of propofol. One-hundred surgical patients were administered indocyanine green immediately before the induction of anesthesia to measure their cardiac outputs and blood volumes. Propofol (250 {$\mu$}g {$\cdot$} kg-1 {$\cdot$} min-1) was infused IV for 8 min, and the hypnotic dose of propofol and the time to hypnosis were recorded. The plasma concentration of propofol immediately after 2 mg/kg infusion was measured. Multiple regression analysis showed that, in addition to age and weight, cardiac output was a small but significant factor for predicting the hypnotic dose of propofol (R2 = 0.468, P {$<$} 0.001), the time to hypnosis (R2 = 0.454, P {$<$} 0.001), and the plasma concentration of propofol (R2 = 0.248, P {$<$} 0.01). Cardiac output, age, and weight showed similar partial coefficients for the hypnotic dose (0.128, 0.137, and 0.140, respectively).},

Features from the output of classic pharmacokinetic models and patient information are considered. Five learning methods are tested including linear models, support vector machine, Kernel, k-neighbors regressors, and neural-network. Learning and testing are performed on a particular subset of 150 surgery cases extracted from the VitalDB database.

Pharmacokinetic studies of dopamine infusion in volunteers and in patients have also shown large variability. The purpose of this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of norepinephrine in septic shock and trauma patients.Methods. After Ethical Committee approval and written informed family consent, 12 patients with septic shock and 11 trauma patients requiring norepinephrine infusion were studied. Norepinephrine dose was increased in three successive steps of 0.1 mg kg-1 min-1 at 15-min intervals (20\% maximum allowed increase in arterial pressure). Arterial blood was sampled before and at 0.5, 13, and 15 min after each infusion rate change and 30 s, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after return to baseline dosing. Norepinephrine was assayed by HPLC. The pharmacokinetics were modelled using NONMEM (one-compartment model).

  abstract = {Cardiac output (CO) is expected to affect elimination and distribution of highly extracted and perfusion rate-limited drugs. This work was undertaken to quantify the effect of CO measured by the pulse pressure method on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol and fentanyl administrated during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). The data were obtained from 22 ASA III patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery. Propofol was administered via target-controlled infusion system (Diprifusor) and fentanyl was administered at a dose of 2\textendash 3~\textmu g/kg each time analgesia appeared to be inadequate. Hemodynamic measurements as well as bispectral index were monitored and recorded throughout the surgery. Data analysis was performed by using a non-linear mixed-effect population modeling (NONMEM 7.4 software). Three compartment models that incorporated blood flows as parameters were used to describe propofol and fentanyl pharmacokinetics. The delay of the anesthetic effect, with respect to plasma concentrations, was described using a biophase (effect) compartment. The bispectral index was linked to the propofol and fentanyl effect site concentrations through a synergistic Emax model. An empirical linear model was used to describe CO changes observed during the surgery. Cardiac output was identified as an important predictor of propofol and fentanyl pharmacokinetics. Consequently, it affected the depth of anesthesia and the recovery time after propofol-fentanyl TIVA infusion cessation. The model predicted (not observed) CO values correlated best with measured responses. Patients` age was identified as a covariate affecting the rate of CO changes during the anesthesia leading to age-related difference in individual patient's responses to both drugs.},

Responses to shaking and shouting and to laryngoscopy were assessed multiple times after allowing for plasma effect site equilibration. The raw electroencephalogram and BIS were recorded throughout the study, and AE was calculated off-line. Response surfaces were fit to the clinical response data using logistic regression or hierarchical response models. Response surfaces were also estimated for BIS and AE. Surfaces were visualized using three-dimensional rotations. Model parameters were estimated with NONMEM.Remifentanil alone had no appreciable effect on response to shaking and shouting or response to laryngoscopy. Propofol could ablate both responses. Modest remifentanil concentrations dramatically reduced the concentrations of propofol required to ablate both responses. The hierarchical response surface described the data better than empirical logistic regression. BIS and AE are more sensitive to propofol than to remifentanil.Remifentanil alone is ineffective at ablating response to stimuli but demonstrates potent synergy with propofol. BIS and AE values corresponding to 95\% probability of ablating response are influenced by the combination of propofol and remifentanil to achieve this endpoint, with higher propofol concentrations producing lower values for BIS and AE.},

  abstract = {Automated systems can improve the stability of controlled variables and reduce the workload in clinical practice without increasing the risks to patients. We conducted this review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical performance of closed-loop systems compared with manual control. Our primary outcome was the accuracy of closed-loop systems in comparison with manual control to maintain a given variable in a desired target range. The occurrence of overshoot and undershoot episodes was the secondary outcome. We retrieved randomized controlled trials on accuracy and safety of closed-loop systems versus manual control. Our primary outcome was the percentage of time during which the system was able to maintain a given variable (eg, bispectral index or oxygen saturation) in a desired range or the proportion of the target measurements that was within the required range. Our secondary outcome was the percentage of time or the number of episodes that the controlled variable was above or below the target range. The standardized mean difference and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes, whereas the odds ratio and 95\% CI were estimated for dichotomous outcomes. Thirty-six trials were included. Compared with manual control, automated systems allowed better maintenance of the controlled variable in the anesthesia drug delivery setting (95\% CI, 11.7\%\textendash 23.1\%; percentage of time, P {$<$} 0.0001, number of studies: n = 15), in patients with diabetes mellitus (95\% CI, 11.5\%\textendash 30.9\%; percentage of time, P = 0.001, n = 8), and in patients mechanically ventilated (95\% CI, 1.5\%\textendash 23.1\%; percentage of time, P = 0.03, n = 8). Heterogeneity among the studies was high ({$>$}75\%). We observed a significant reduction of episodes of overshooting and undershooting when closed-loop systems were used. The use of automated systems can result in better control of a given target within a selected range. There was a decrease of overshooting or undershooting of a given target with closed-loop systems.},

  abstract = {Background. Remifentanil is known to cause bradycardia and hypotension. We aimed to characterize the haemodynamic profile of remifentanil during sevoflurane anaesthesia in children with or without atropine.Methods. Forty children who required elective surgery received inhalational induction of anaesthesia using 8\% sevoflurane. They were allocated randomly to receive either atropine, 20 \textmu g kg-1 (atropine group) or Ringer's lactate (control group) after 10 min of steady-state 1 MAC sevoflurane anaesthesia (baseline). Three minutes later (T0), all children received remifentanil 1 \textmu g kg-1 injected over a 60 s period, followed by an infusion of 0.25 \textmu g kg-1 min-1 for 10 min then 0.5 \textmu g kg-1 min-1 for 10 min. Haemodynamic variables and echocardiographic data were determined at baseline, T0, T5, T10, T15 and T20 min.Results. Remifentanil caused a significant decrease in heart rate compared with the T0 value, which was greater at T20 than T10 in the two groups: however, the values at T10 and T20 were not significantly different from baseline in the atropine group. In comparison with T0, there was a significant fall in blood pressure in the two groups. Remifentanil caused a significant decrease in the cardiac index with or without atropine. Remifentanil did not cause variation in stroke volume (SV). In both groups, a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance occurred after administration of remifentanil. Contractility decreased significantly in the two groups, but this decrease remained moderate (between -2 and +2 sd).Conclusion. Remifentanil produced a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index, mainly as a result of a fall in heart rate. Although atropine was able to reduce the fall in heart rate, it did not completely prevent the reduction in cardiac index.},

A model reference adaptive control structure was chosen for the entire system. First of all, to control the patient's state during the surgery process, the patient mathematical model is useful, or even required for simulation studies. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model was determined using MATLAB's SimBiology tool, starting from a previously available block diagram, and validated through simulation. Then, to achieve the desired control performances, two controllers are designed: a PI adaptive controller and a \-PI{$\lambda$} (PI-fractional) adaptive controller, using the MIT algorithm. The time response during anesthetic drug infusion for each patient can be plotted with the AnesthesiaGUIDE tool, which is also designed in MATLAB/Simulink. The tool was tested on data from 12 patients, subjected to general anesthesia, with successful results. Through this tool, the article provides a good opportunity for any user to experience with adaptive control for the anesthesia process.},

  abstract = {Although arterial hypotension occurs frequently with propofol use in humans, its effects on intravascular volume and vascular capacitance are uncertain. We hypothesized that propofol decreases vascular capacitance and therefore decreases stressed volume. Cardiac output (CO) was measured using Modelflow \textregistered{} in 17 adult subjects after upper abdominal surgery. Mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and vascular resistances were calculated using venous return curves constructed by measuring steady-state arterial and venous pressures and CO during inspiratory hold manoeuvres at increasing plateau pressures. Measurements were performed at three incremental levels of targeted blood propofol concentrations.  Mean blood propofol concentrations for the three targeted levels were 3.0, 4.5, and 6.5 \textmu g ml -1 . Mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, MSFP, venous return pressure, Rv, systemic arterial resistance, and resistance of the systemic circulation decreased, stroke volume variation increased, and CO was not significantly different as propofol concentration increased. An increase in propofol concentration within the therapeutic range causes a decrease in vascular stressed volume without a change in CO. The absence of an effect of propofol on CO can be explained by the balance between the decrease in effective, or stressed, volume (as determined by MSFP), the decrease in resistance for venous return, and slightly improved heart function.Netherlands Trial Register: NTR2486.},

Our aim was to develop a PK\textendash PD model for propofol that can predict the bispectral index (BIS) for a broad population, suitable for TCI applications. Methods Propofol PK data were obtained from 30 previously published studies, five of which also contained BIS observations. A PK\textendash PD model was developed using NONMEM. Weight, age, post-menstrual age (PMA), height, sex, BMI, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs were explored as covariates. The predictive performance was measured across young children, children, adults, elderly, and high-BMI individuals, and in simulated TCI applications. Results Overall, 15 433 propofol concentration and 28 639 BIS observations from 1033 individuals (672 males and 361 females) were analysed. The age range was from 27 weeks PMA to 88 yr, and the weight range was 0.68\textendash 160 kg. The final model uses age, PMA, weight, height, sex, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs as covariates.

The propofol TCI administration using the model matches well with recommendations for all age groups considered for both anaesthesia and sedation. Conclusions We developed a PK\textendash PD model to predict the propofol concentrations and BIS for broad, diverse population. This should be useful for TCI in anaesthesia and sedation.},

  abstract = {Automation empowers self-sustainable adaptive processes and personalized services in many industries. The implementation of the integrated healthcare paradigm built on Health 4.0 is expected to transform any area in medicine due to the lightning-speed advances in control, robotics, artificial intelligence, sensors etc. The two objectives of this article, as addressed to different entities, are: i) to raise awareness throughout the anesthesiologists about the usefulness of integrating automation and data exchange in their clinical practice for providing increased attention to alarming situations, ii) to provide the actualized insights of drug-delivery research in order to create an opening horizon towards precision medicine with significantly improved human outcomes. This article presents a concise overview on the recent evolution of closed-loop anesthesia delivery control systems by means of control strategies, depth of anesthesia monitors, patient modelling, safety systems, and validation in clinical trials. For decades, anesthesia control has been in the midst of transformative changes, going from simple controllers to integrative strategies of two or more components, but not achieving yet the breakthrough of an integrated system. However, the scientific advances that happen at high speed need a modern review to identify the current technological gaps, societal implications, and implementation barriers. This article provides a good basis for control research in clinical anesthesia to endorse new challenges for intelligent systems towards individualized patient care. At this connection point of clinical and engineering frameworks through (semi-) automation, the following can be granted: patient safety, economical efficiency, and clinicians' efficacy.},

  abstract = {Introduction We sought to examine the cardiac consequences of early administration of norepinephrine in severely hypotensive sepsis patients hospitalized in a medical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Methods We included 105 septic-shock patients who already had received volume resuscitation. All received norepinephrine early because of life-threatening hypotension and the need to achieve a sufficient perfusion pressure rapidly and to maintain adequate flow. We analyzed the changes in transpulmonary thermodilution variables associated with the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by norepinephrine when the achieved MAP was {$\geq$}65 mm Hg. Results Norepinephrine significantly increased MAP from 54 {$\pm$} 8 to 76 {$\pm$} 9 mm Hg, cardiac index (CI) from 3.2 {$\pm$} 1.0 to 3.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 L/min/m2, stroke volume index (SVI) from 34 {$\pm$} 12 to 39 {$\pm$} 13 ml/m2, global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) from 694 {$\pm$} 148 to 742 {$\pm$} 168 ml/m2, and cardiac function index (CFI) from 4.7 {$\pm$} 1.5 to 5.0 {$\pm$} 1.6 per min. Beneficial hemodynamic effects on CI, SVI, GEDVI, and CFI were observed in the group of 71 patients with a baseline echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) {$>$}45\%, as well as in the group of 34 patients with a baseline LVEF {$\leq$}45\%. No change in CI, SVI, GEDVI, or CFI was observed in the 17 patients with baseline LVEF {$\leq$}45\% for whom values of MAP {$\geq$}75 mm Hg were achieved with norepinephrine. Conclusions Early administration of norepinephrine aimed at rapidly achieving a sufficient perfusion pressure in severely hypotensive septic-shock patients is able to increase cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload and cardiac contractility. This effect remained in patients with poor cardiac contractility except when values of MAP {$\geq$}75 mm Hg were achieved.},

  abstract = {Regulating the depth of hypnosis during surgery is one of the major objectives of an anesthesia infusion system. Continuous administration of Propofol infusion during surgical procedures is essential but it unduly increases the load of an anesthetist working in a multitasking scenario in the operation theatre. Manual and target controlled infusion systems are not appropriate to handle instabilities like blood pressure and heart rate changes arising due to interpatient and intrapatient variability. Patient safety, large interindividual variability, and less postoperative effects are the main factors motivating automation in anesthesia administration. The idea of automated system for Propofol infusion excites control engineers to come up with more sophisticated systems that can handle optimum delivery of anesthetic drugs during surgery and avoid postoperative effects. A linear control technique is applied initially using three compartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. Later on, sliding mode control and model predicative control achieve considerable results with nonlinear sigmoid model. Chattering and uncertainties are further improved by employing adaptive fuzzy control and control. The proposed sliding mode control scheme can easily handle the nonlinearities and achieve an optimum hypnosis level as compared to linear control schemes, hence preventing mishaps such as underdosing and overdosing of anesthesia.},

The result is an open source patient simulator in Matlab/Simulink from Mathworks(R). Simulator features include complex synergic and antagonistic interaction aspects between general anesthesia and hemodynamic stabilization variables. The anesthetic system includes the hypnosis, analgesia and neuromuscular blockade states, while the hemodynamic system includes the cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. Nociceptor stimulation is also described and acts as a disturbance together with predefined surgery profiles from a translation into signal form of most commonly encountered events in clinical practice. A broad population set of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) variables are available for the user to describe both intra- and inter-patient variability. This simulator has some unique features, such as: i) additional bolus administration from anesthesiologist, ii) variable time-delays introduced by data window averaging when poor signal quality is detected, iii) drug trapping from heterogeneous tissue diffusion in high body mass index patients. We successfully reproduced the clinical expected effects of various drugs interacting among the anesthetic and hemodynamic states. Our work is uniquely defined in current state of the art and first of its kind for this application of dose management problem in anesthesia.

The authors hypothesized that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil, an esterase metabolized opioid that does not require delivery to a metabolic organ, would be altered less by hemorrhagic shock that those of fentanyl.Sixteen pigs were assigned randomly to control and shock groups. The shock group was bled using an isobaric hemorrhage model. Remifentanil 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) was infused for 10 min to both groups. Arterial samples were collected for remifentanil concentration assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a three-compartment model. The electroencephalogram spectral edge was used as a measure of drug effect. The pharmacodynamics were characterized using a sigmoid inhibitory maximal effect model.Remifentanil blood levels were higher in the shocked group. The central clearance was slower and the central compartment was smaller in shocked animals. No difference between groups was observed in the magnitude or time course of the remifentanil-induced decrease in spectral edge.Hemorrhagic shock altered the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil, suggesting that less remifentanil would be required to maintain a target plasma concentration. However, because of its rapid metabolism, the impact of hemorrhagic shock on the concentration decline of remifentanil after termination of the infusion was minimal. Hemorrhagic shock did not alter the pharmacodynamics of remifentanil.},

  abstract = {Propofol is a common sedative hypnotic for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Clinicians typically moderate the dose of propofol or choose a different sedative hypnotic in the setting of severe intravascular volume depletion. Previous work has established that hemorrhagic shock influences both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol in the rat. To investigate this further, the authors studied the influence of hemorrhagic shock on the pharmacology of propofol in a swine isobaric hemorrhage model.After approval from the Animal Care Committee, 16 swine were randomly assigned to control and shock groups. The shock group was bled to a mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mmHg over a 20-min period and held there by further blood removal until 30 ml/kg of blood was removed. Propofol 200 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) was infused for 10 min to both groups. Arterial samples (15 from each animal) were collected at frequent intervals until 180 min after the infusion began and analyzed to determine drug concentration. Pharmacokinetic parameters for each group were estimated using a three-compartment model. The electroencephalogram Bispectral Index Scale was used as a measure of drug effect. The pharmacodynamics were characterized using a sigmoid inhibitory maximal effect model.The raw data demonstrated higher plasma propofol levels in the shock group. The pharmacokinetic analysis revealed slower intercompartmental clearances in the shock group. Hemorrhagic shock shifted the concentration effect relationship to the left, demonstrating a 2.7-fold decrease in the effect site concentration required to achieve 50\% of the maximal effect in the Bispectral Index Scale.Hemorrhagic shock altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol. Changes in intercompartmental clearances and an increase in the potency of propofol suggest that less propofol would be required to achieve a desired drug effect during hemorrhagic shock.},

  abstract = {As propofol is a high-clearance drug, plasma propofol concentrations can be influenced by cardiac output (CO), which can easily change in response to several factors. If propofol is metabolized in the lungs, the difference between pulmonary and arterial propofol concentrations might also be affected by CO. The objective of the current study was to assess how much plasma propofol concentrations are affected by CO and to determine how much the lungs take part in propofol elimination and in concentration changes affected by CO in anesthetized swine.Thirteen swine were studied. Propofol was administered via a peripheral vein at a rate of 6 mg x kg(-1) x h(- 1), and blood samples were simultaneously collected from pulmonary and femoral arteries at 0, 2, 3.5, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 min and at 20-min intervals up to 270 min. After 90 min of sampling (baseline 1), CO increased in response to a continuous infusion of dobutamine (20 microg x kg(-1) x min(- 1); high-CO state); the infusion was then stopped, and CO was allowed to return to baseline (baseline 2). Finally, CO decreased with the administration of propranolol (2.0-4.0 mg administered intravenously; low-CO state). Each hemodynamic status was maintained for 1 h.As CO increased 36\% from baseline 1, plasma propofol concentrations decreased by 18\% from baseline 1, and as CO decreased 42\% from baseline 1, plasma propofol concentrations increased by 70\% from baseline 1. Plasma propofol concentrations can be expressed by the following equation: plasma propofol concentration (micrograms per milliliter) = 6.51/CO (l/min) + 1.11 (r = 0.78, P \&lt; 0.0001). No significant differences were observed between plasma propofol concentrations in pulmonary and femoral arteries in any state, and CO caused no apparent differences between pulmonary and arterial propofol concentrations.An inverse relation was observed between CO and propofol concentrations. The lungs appear to have a minor effect on plasma propofol concentrations during constant infusion in anesthetized swine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic shock increases the hypnotic effect of propofol, but the influence of hemorrhagic shock on the immobilizing effect of propofol is not fully defined. METHODS: Twenty-four swine (30.3 Ϯ 3.6 kg) were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and randomly assigned to either a control (n ϭ 12) or a hemorrhagic shock (n ϭ 12) group. Animals in the shock group were bled to a mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg and maintained at this level for 60 min. After isoflurane inhalation was stopped, propofol was infused at 50 mg {$\frac{1}{7}$} kgϪ1 {$\frac{1}{7}$} hϪ1 until no movement was observed after application of a dewclaw clamp every 2 min. Arterial samples for measurement of the propofol concentration were collected just before each use of the dewclaw clamp and the Bispectral Index (BIS) was also recorded. Analysis of the pharmacodynamics was performed using a sigmoidal inhibitory maximal effect model for BIS versus effect-site concentration and a logistic regression analysis for the probability of movement versus effect-site concentration. RESULTS: The propofol doses needed to reach a 50\% decrease from baseline BIS, and no movement after noxious stimuli were reduced by hemorrhagic shock by 54\% and 38\%, respectively. Hemorrhagic shock decreased the effect-site concentration that produced 50\% of the maximal BIS effect from 11.6 Ϯ 3.8 to 9.1 Ϯ 1.7 ␮g/mL and that producing a 50\% probability of movement from 26.8 Ϯ 1.0 to 20.6 Ϯ 1.0 ␮g/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that hemorrhagic shock increases both the hypnotic and immobilizing effects of propofol due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, with the changes in pharmacodynamics occurring to a similar extent for both effects.},

The Vital Recorder's automatic recording and remote monitoring capabilities enabled us to record physiological big data with minimal effort. The Vital Recorder also provided time-synchronised data captured from a variety of devices to facilitate an integrated analysis of vital signs data.

  abstract = {Optimization-based techniques can be usefully employed in the design of control systems in general anesthesia. In particular, in this chapter, the control of the depth-of-hypnosis by using the bispectral index scale signal as process variable is considered. The general approach consists in first optimizing the controller parameters by using an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the worst-case performance index over a reduced set of models of patients. To this end, the integrated absolute error is chosen as optimization functional, and the set of models of patients is rich enough to be representative of a wide population. Then, the robustness to intra- and interpatient variability is verified by testing the devised control system on a wide set of patients, determined, for example, by using a Monte Carlo method. This methodology can be applied to different control schemes and allows the fulfillment of the clinical specifications.},

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the new short-acting opioid remifentanil.Sixty-five healthy adults (38 men and 27 women) ages 20 to 85 y received remifentanil by constant-rate infusion of 1 to 8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 4 to 20 min. Frequent arterial blood samples were drawn and assayed for remifentanil concentration. The electroencephalogram was used as a measure of drug effect. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using the software package NONMEM. The influence of volunteer covariates were analyzed using a generalized additive model. The performances of the simple (without covariates) and complex (with covariates) models were evaluated prospectively in an additional 15 healthy participants ages 41 to 84 y.The parameters for the simple three-compartment pharmacokinetic model were V1 = 4.98 l, V2 = 9.01 l, V3 = 6.54 l, Cl1 = 2.46 l/min, Cl2 = 1.69 l/min, and Cl3 = 0.065 l/min. Age and lean body mass were significant covariates. From the ages of 20 to 85 y, V1 and Cl1 decreased by approximately 25\% and 33\%, respectively. The parameters for the simple sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model were Ke0 = 0.516 min-1, E0 = 20 Hz, Emax = 5.62 Hz, EC50 = 11.2 ng/ml, and gamma = 2.51. Age was a significant covariate of EC50 and Ke0, with both decreasing by approximately 50\% for the age range studied. The complex pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model performed better than did the simple model when applied prospectively.This study identified (1) an effect of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil; (2) an effect of lean body mass on the pharmacokinetic parameters; and (3) no influence of gender on any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameter.},

Design:~         Prospective interventional study.         Setting:~         Medical Intensive Care Unit.         Patients:~         We included 25 septic shock patients (62 {$\pm$} 13 yrs old, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 53 {$\pm$} 12, lactate 3.5 {$\pm$} 2.1 mmol/L, all receiving norepinephrine at baseline at 0.24 [25\%\textendash 75\% interquartile range: 0.12\textendash 0.48] {$\mu$}g/kg/min) with a positive passive leg raising test (defined by an increase in cardiac index {$\geq$}10\%) and a diastolic arterial pressure {$\leq$}40 mm Hg.         Interventions:~         We performed a passive leg raising test (during 1 min) at baseline. Immediately after, we increased the dose of norepinephrine (to 0.48 [0.36\textendash 0.71] {$\mu$}g/kg/min) and, when the hemodynamic status was stabilized, we performed a second passive leg raising test (during 1 min). We finally infused 500 mL saline.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Increasing the dose of norepinephrine significantly increased central venous pressure (+23\% {$\pm$} 12\%), left ventricular end-diastolic area (+9\% {$\pm$} 6\%), E mitral wave (+19\% {$\pm$} 23\%), and global end-diastolic volume (+9\% {$\pm$} 6\%). Simultaneously, cardiac index significantly increased by 11\% {$\pm$} 7\%, suggesting that norepinephrine had recruited some cardiac preload reserve. The second passive leg raising test increased cardiac index to a lesser extent than the baseline test (13\% {$\pm$} 8\% vs. + 19\% {$\pm$} 6\%, p {$<$} .05), suggesting that norepinephrine had decreased the degree of preload dependency. Volume infusion significantly increased cardiac index by 26\% {$\pm$} 15\%. However, cardiac index increased by {$<$}15\% in four patients (fluid unresponsive patients) while the baseline passive leg raising test was positive in these patients. In three of these four patients, the second passive leg raising test was also negative, i.e., the second passive leg raising test (after norepinephrine increase) predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 95 [76\textendash 99]\% and a specificity of 100 [30\textendash 100]\%.         Conclusions:~         In septic patients with a positive passive leg raising test at baseline suggesting the presence of preload dependency, norepinephrine increased cardiac preload and cardiac index and reduced the degree of preload dependency.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~         Closed-loop systems for anesthesia delivery have been shown to outperform traditional manual control in different clinical settings. The present trial was aimed at evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of Bispectral Index (BISTM)-guided closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) in comparison with manual control across multiple centers in India.         METHODS:~         Adult patients scheduled for major surgical procedures of an expected duration of 1 to 3 hours were randomized across 6 sites into 2 groups: a CLADS group and a manual group. In the manual control group, propofol infusion was titrated manually by the attending anesthesiologist to a BIS of 50 during induction and maintenance. Analgesia was maintained with fentanyl infusion and nitrous oxide in both groups. In the CLADS group, both induction and maintenance of anesthesia were performed automatically using CLADS. The primary outcome measure was the performance of the system as assessed by the percentage of total anesthesia time BIS remained {$\pm$}10 of target BIS. The secondary outcome measures were a percentage of anesthesia-time heart rate and mean arterial pressure within 25\% of the baseline, median absolute performance error, wobble, and global score. Wobble indicates intraindividual variability in the control of BIS, and global score reflects the overall performance; lower values indicate superior performance for both parameters. The performance parameters of the system also were compared among the participating sites.         RESULTS:~         Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. BIS was maintained within {$\pm$}10 of target for significantly longer time in the CLADS group (81.4\% {$\pm$} 8.9 \% of anesthesia duration) than in the manual group (55.34\% {$\pm$} 25\%, P {$<$} 0.0001). The indices that assess performance were significantly better in the CLADS group than the manual group as follows: median absolute performance error was 10 (10, 12) (median [interquartile range]) in the CLADS group versus 18 (14, 24) in the manual group, P {$<$} 0.0001; wobble was 9 (8, 10) in CLADS group versus 10 (8, 14) in the manual group, P = 0.0009; and Global score, which reflects overall performance, was 24 (19, 30) in the CLADS group versus 51 (31, 99) in the manual group, P {$<$} 0.0001. The percentage of time heart rate was within 25\% of the baseline was significantly greater in the CLADS group (heart rate of 95 [87, 99], median [interquartile range], in the CLADS group versus 90 [75, 98] in the manual group P = 0.0031). On comparison of data between the centers, the performance parameters did not differ significantly among the centers in the CLADS group (P = 0.94), but the parameters differed significantly among the centers in the manual group (P {$<$} 0.001).         CONCLUSIONS:~         Our study in a multicenter setting proves the consistently better performance of automated anesthesia drug delivery compared with conventional manual control. This highlights an important advantage of an automated system for delivering standardized anesthesia, thereby overcoming differences in practices among anesthesiologists.},

Methods: The optimized bolus minimizes the time-to-target and it is used as a feedforward action together with a specifically tuned PID feedback control system where the bispectral index is the controlled variable. Results: A Monte Carlo method is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Both intra-patient and inter-patient variability has been considered. A comparison with a control scheme based on a feedback PID controller only shows that the use of an optimized feedforward action allows an average reduction of the time-to-target of more than 25\%, with an acceptable increment of the undershoot, which always remains above the BIS level of 30. Conclusions: The use of an optimized bolus of propofol as a feedforward action in a fully automatic control system for the induction phase of anesthesia allows the anesthesiologist to reduce the transient time to obtain the required level of depth-of-hypnosis, without affecting the safety of the patient.},

  abstract = {The authors studied the influence of age on the pharmacodynamics of propofol, including characterization of the relation between plasma concentration and the time course of drug effect.The authors evaluated healthy volunteers aged 25-81 yr. A bolus dose (2 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg in persons older than 65 yr) and an infusion (25, 50, 100, or 200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) of the older or the new (containing EDTA) formulation of propofol were given on each of two different study days. The propofol concentration was determined in frequent arterial samples. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure drug effect. A statistical technique called semilinear canonical correlation was used to select components of the EEG power spectrum that correlated optimally with the effect-site concentration. The effect-site concentration was related to drug effect with a biphasic pharmacodynamic model. The plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant was estimated parametrically. Estimates of this rate constant were validated by comparing the predicted time of peak effect with the time of peak EEG effect. The probability of being asleep, as a function of age, was determined from steady state concentrations after 60 min of propofol infusion.Twenty-four volunteers completed the study. Three parameters of the biphasic pharmacodynamic model were correlated linearly with age. The plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant was 0.456 min(-1). The predicted time to peak effect after bolus injection ranging was 1.7 min. The time to peak effect assessed visually was 1.6 min (range, 1-2.4 min). The steady state observations showed increasing sensitivity to propofol in elderly patients, with C50 values for loss of consciousness of 2.35, 1.8, and 1.25 microg/ml in volunteers who were 25, 50, and 75 yr old, respectively.Semilinear canonical correlation defined a new measure of propofol effect on the EEG, the canonical univariate parameter for propofol. Using this parameter, propofol plasma effect-site equilibration is faster than previously reported. This fast onset was confirmed by inspection of the EEG data. Elderly patients are more sensitive to the hypnotic and EEG effects of propofol than are younger persons.},

Weight was found to be a significant covariate for elimination clearance, the two intercompartmental clearances, and the volumes of the central compartment, the shallow peripheral compartment, and the deep peripheral compartment; power functions with exponents smaller than 1 yielded the best results. The estimates of these parameters for a 70-kg adult were 1.44 l/min, 2.25 l/min, 0.92 l/min, 9.3 l, 44.2 l, and 266 l, respectively. For patients older than 60 yr the elimination clearance decreased linearly. The volume of the central compartment decreased with age. For children, all parameters were increased when normalized to body weight. Venous data showed a decreased elimination clearance; bolus data were characterized by increases in the volumes of the central and shallow peripheral compartments and in the rapid distribution clearance (Cl2) and a decrease in the slow distribution clearance (Cl3).Pharmacokinetics of propofol can be well described by a three-compartment model. Inclusion of age and weight as covariates significantly improved the model. Adjusting pharmacokinetics to the individual patient should improve the precision of target-controlled infusion and may help to broaden the field of application for target-controlled infusion systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~         Propofol and remifentanil are commonly combined for total IV anesthesia. The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug interactions of the combination are well understood, but the use of a combined PK and PD model to control target-controlled infusion pumps has not been investigated. In this study, we prospectively tested the accuracy of a PD target-controlled infusion algorithm for propofol and remifentanil using a response surface model of their combined effects on Bispectral Index (BIS).         METHODS:~         Effect-site, target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil were given using an algorithm based on standard PK models linked to a PD response surface model of their combined effects on BIS. The combination of a targeted BIS value and adjustable ratio of propofol to remifentanil was used to adjust infusion rates. The standard model performance measures of median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (inaccuracy), expressed as percentages, were used to assess accuracy of the infusions in a convenience sample of 50 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. The influence of age and weight on the performance of the model was also assessed.         RESULTS:~         Patients had a mean (range) age of 48 (19\textendash 73) years, weight of 80 (45\textendash 169) kg, and body mass index of 28 (19\textendash 45) kg/m2. The overall model had a bias of 8\% (SD 24\%) and inaccuracy of 25\% (SD 13\%). Performance was least accurate during the early induction phase of anesthesia. There was no significant bias in BIS predictions with increasing age (P = 0.44) or weight (P = 0.56).         CONCLUSIONS:~         The algorithm performed adequately in a clinical setting. The algorithm could be further refined, and assessment of its accuracy and utility in comparison to current clinical practice for giving IV anesthesia is warranted.},

  abstract = {Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to diagnostic, therapeutic, and intervention-based applications in the field of medicine. Today, there is a deep chasm between AI-based research articles and their translation to clinical anesthesia, which needs to be addressed. Machine learning (ML), the most widely applied arm of AI in medicine, confers the ability to analyze large volumes of data, find associations, and predict outcomes with ongoing learning by the computer. It involves algorithm creation, testing and analyses with the ability to perform cognitive functions including association between variables, pattern recognition, and prediction of outcomes. AI-supported closed loops have been designed for pharmacological maintenance of anesthesia and hemodynamic management. Mechanical robots can perform dexterity and skill-based tasks such as intubation and regional blocks with precision, whereas clinical-decision support systems in crisis situations may augment the role of the clinician. The possibilities are boundless, yet widespread adoption of AI is still far from the ground reality. Patient-related ``Big Data'' collection, validation, transfer, and testing are under ethical scrutiny. For this narrative review, we conducted a PubMed search in 2020-21 and retrieved articles related to AI and anesthesia. After careful consideration of the content, we prepared the review to highlight the growing importance of AI in anesthesia. Awareness and understanding of the basics of AI are the first steps to be undertaken by clinicians. In this narrative review, we have discussed salient features of ongoing AI research related to anesthesia and perioperative care.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Although remifentanil has been used to induce hypotension during surgery in infants, no pharmacokinetic\textendash pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model exists for its quantitative analysis. Our aim was to determine the quantitative relationship between whole blood remifentanil concentration and its hypotensive effect during surgery in infants. Methods/materials: We studied seven infants (age 0.3\textendash 1 year) who underwent cranioplasty surgery and received remifentanil delivered by a computer-controlled infusion pump during the maintenance of anesthesia. Arterial blood samples to determine remifentanil concentration and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measurements were collected. A simultaneous PKPD mixed-effects model was built in NONMEM. Results: A total of 77 remifentanil concentrations and 185 MAP measurements were collected. Remifentanil pharmacokinetics was described with a two-compartment model, parameter estimates were 2.99 l{$\cdot$}min-1{$\cdot$}70 kg-1 for clearance and 16.23 l{$\cdot$}70 kg-1 for steady state volume of distribution. Mean baseline MAP was 69.7 mmHg and was decreased as per clinical requirements. A sigmoidal Emax model driven by an effect compartment described the decrease in MAP, with an estimated concentration to decrease MAP by half (EC50) being 17.1 ng{$\cdot$}ml-1. Conclusions: Remifentanil is effective in causing hypotension. The final model predicts that a steady state remifentanil concentration of 14 ng{$\cdot$}ml-1 would typically achieve a 30\% decrease in MAP.},

  abstract = {Target-controlled infusion (TCI) systems can control the concentration in the plasma or at the site of drug effect. A TCI system that targets the effect site should be able to accurately predict the time course of drug effect. The authors tested this by comparing the performance of three control algorithms: plasmacontrol TCI versus two algorithms for effect-site control TCI.One-hundred twenty healthy women patients received propofol via TCI for 12-min at a target concentration of 5.4 microg/ml. In all three groups, the plasma concentrations were computed using pharmacokinetics previously reported. In group I, the TCI device controlled the plasma concentration. In groups II and III, the TCI device controlled the effect-site concentration. In group II, the effect site was computed using a half-life for plasma effect-site equilibration (t1/2k(eo)) of 3.5 min. In group III, plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant (k(eo)) was computed to yield a time to peak effect of 1.6 min after bolus injection, yielding a t1/2keo of 34 s. the time course of propofol was measured using the bispectral index. Blood pressure, ventilation, and time of loss of consciousness were measured.The time course of propofol drug effect, as measured by the bispectral index, was best predicted in group III. Targeting the effect-site concentration shortened the time to loss of consciousness compared with the targeting plasma concentration without causing hypotension. The incidence of apnea was less in group III than in group II.Effect compartment-controlled TCI can be safely applied in clinical practice. A biophase model combining the Marsh kinetics and a time to peak effect of 1.6 min accurately predicted the time course of propofol drug effect.},

  abstract = {Indicator dilution theory predicts that the first-pass pulmonary and systemic arterial concentrations of a drug will be inversely related to the cardiac output. For high-clearance drugs, these first-pass concentrations may contribute significantly to the measured arterial concentrations, which would therefore also be inversely related to cardiac output. We examined the cardiac output dependence of the initial kinetics of propofol in two separate studies using chronically instrumented sheep in which propofol (100 mg) was infused IV over 2 min. In the first study, steady-state periods of low, medium, and high cardiac output were achieved by altering carbon dioxide tension in six halothane-anesthetized sheep. The initial area under the curve and peak value of the pulmonary artery propofol concentrations were inversely related to cardiac output (R2 = 0.57 and 0.66, respectively). For the systemic arterial concentrations, these R2 values were 0.68 and 0.71, respectively. In our second study, transient reductions in cardiac output were achieved in five conscious sheep by administering a short infusion of metaraminol concurrently with propofol. Cardiac output was lowered by 2.2 L/min, and the area under the curve to 10 min of the arterial concentrations increased to 143\% of control.         Implications~         The initial arterial concentrations of propofol after IV administration were shown to be inversely related to cardiac output. This implies that cardiac output may be a determinant of the induction of anesthesia with propofol.},
