    "Tasty Bytes is a global food truck network operating in 15 countries with fleet of 450 trucks. They collect customer reviews to get customer feedback on their food-trucks which come in from multiple sources and span multiple languages. This enables them to better understand the areas which require improvement and drive up customer loyalty along with satisfaction. \n",
