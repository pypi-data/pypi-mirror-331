    You can materialize the entire buffer by using either `bytes` or `bytes_async`, or
    you can stream the result using `stream`. `__iter__` and `__aiter__` are implemented
    as aliases to `stream`, so you can alternatively call `iter()` or `aiter()` on
    `GetResult` to start an iterator.

    Using as an async iterator:
    ```py
    resp = await obs.get_async(store, path)
    # 5MB chunk size in stream
    stream = resp.stream(min_chunk_size=5 * 1024 * 1024)
    async for buf in stream:
        print(len(buf))
    ```

    Using as a sync iterator:
    ```py
    resp = obs.get(store, path)
    # 20MB chunk size in stream
    stream = resp.stream(min_chunk_size=20 * 1024 * 1024)
    for buf in stream:
        print(len(buf))
    ```

    Note that after calling `bytes`, `bytes_async`, or `stream`, you will no longer be
    able to call other methods on this object, such as the `meta` attribute.
