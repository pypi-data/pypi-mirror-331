# Torchless EasyOCR

This package is EasyOCR-based optical character recognition. Unlike EasyOCR, the package uses a pre-saved with `onnx` language models, so it doesn't need a 1-2 Gb `pytorch` dependency. This is particularly useful for developing and packaging light-weight applications that utilize text recognition.


#### Comparison for virtual env size


- **272 MB** `torchfree_ocr` with dependencies
- **1.52 GB** `easyocr` with dependencies
- **4.79 GB** `easyocr` with dependencies + GPU enabled

More importantly, packed python .exe loads and runs much faster with `torchfree_ocr`

## requirements.txt
``` bash
opencv-python-headless
numpy
onnxruntime
Pillow
python-bidi
```

## Limitations
There is no GPU CUDA support.


## Performance of `torchfree_ocr` vs `easyocr`
In terms of recognition, there is no visible recognition quality difference between `torchfree_ocr` and `easyocr`.
In terms of speed `torchfree_ocr` works a bit faster than `easyocr` in CPU mode (~30% faster).
Obviously, `easyocr` generally runs much faster in GPU mode, which `torchfree_ocr` doesn't support.

## Installation

Install using `pip`

For the latest release:

``` bash
pip install torchfree_ocr
```
or 
``` bash
pip install torchfree-ocr
```

## Usage

``` python
import torchfree_ocr
reader = torchfree_ocr.Reader(["en"]) # Supports all EasyOCR languages
result = reader.readtext('english.png')
```

The output will be in a list format, each item represents a bounding box, the text detected and confident level, respectively.

``` bash

```
Note 1: Instead of the filepath `english.png`, you can also pass an OpenCV image object (numpy array) or an image file as bytes. A URL to a raw image is also acceptable.

Note 2: The line `reader = easyocr.Reader(["en"])` is for loading a model into memory. It takes some time but it needs to be run only once.

You can also set `detail=0` for simpler output.

``` python
reader.readtext('english.png', detail = 0)
```
Result:
``` bash
['Reduce your risk of coronavirus infection:', 'Clean hands with soap and water', 'or alcohol-based hand rub', 'Cover nose and mouth when coughing and', 'sneezing with tissue or flexed elbow', 'Avoid close contact with anyone with', 'cold or flu-like symptoms', 'Thoroughly cook meat and eggs', 'No unprotected contact with live wild', 'or farm animals', 'World Health', 'Organization']
```
Averall, usage is the same as with EasyOCR, except `Reader` in this package only has `lang_list` and `recognizer=True` parameters.

Usage for EasyOCR can be found in their [tutorial](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/tutorial) and [API Documentation](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/documentation).

#### Run on command line

```shell
$ torchfree_ocr -l en -f english.png --detail=1
```
