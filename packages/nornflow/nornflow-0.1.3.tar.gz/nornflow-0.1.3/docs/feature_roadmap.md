This high-level roadmap outlines the strategic direction for NornFlow development.

## Current Capabilities

- **Core Functionality**: Task execution, workflow management, inventory handling
- **CLI Tools**: Basic commands for initialization, execution, and information display
- **Workflow Management**: YAML-based workflow definitions with task sequencing

## Near-Term Priorities

### Advanced Filtering
- Enhanced inventory filtering capabilities
- Support for custom/imported filter functions

### Output & Processing
- Support for custom/imported output processor support
- Enhanced result presentation

### Workflow Enhancements
- Conditional logic in workflows
- Loop structures

### Modular Component Sharing (Community Package Ecosystem)
- Support for importing tasks, filters, and processors from external Python packages
- Standardized package structure for NornFlow components
- Package discovery and automated registration mechanisms (not sure if required, as this could be simply a setting in nonrflow.yaml)
- Guidelines for developing shareable NornFlow components

## Future Enhancements

### User Experience
- Improved exception handling and error reporting

### Technical Foundation
- Settings management refinements
- Workflow, TaskModel and WorkflowModel classes most certainly can be improved. üß† ‚öôÔ∏è
- Documentation improvements

## Continuous Improvement

- Bug fixes and stability enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Evaluate community input for general improvements
