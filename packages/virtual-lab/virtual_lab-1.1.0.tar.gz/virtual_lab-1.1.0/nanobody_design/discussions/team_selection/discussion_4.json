You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the antibody/nanobody design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research\",\n    goal=\"perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources\",\n)\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
