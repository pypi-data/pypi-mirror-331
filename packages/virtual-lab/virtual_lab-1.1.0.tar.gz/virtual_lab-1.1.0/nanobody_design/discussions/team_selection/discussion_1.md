This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the antibody/nanobody design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To tackle the challenge of developing antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, I propose assembling a team with diverse expertise in artificial intelligence, structural biology, and immunology. Here are the three scientists I would like to invite to discuss and create our design approach:

1. **Agent**(
   - title="Computational Biologist",
   - expertise="protein structure prediction and modeling",
   - goal="develop and refine predictive models for protein-antibody interactions",
   - role="provide insights into molecular dynamics and structural constraints impacting antibody design",
   )

2. **Agent**(
   - title="AI/ML Specialist",
   - expertise="machine learning algorithms and data analysis",
   - goal="implement and optimize machine learning models for antibody discovery",
   - role="lead the development of AI models to predict broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants",
   )

3. **Agent**(
   - title="Immunologist",
   - expertise="antibody response and epitope mapping",
   - goal="identify key antigenic sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
   - role="guide the selection of target epitopes and provide biological insights into immune evasion mechanisms",
   )

These team members will bring critical knowledge and skills needed to effectively design and optimize antibodies or nanobodies with broad-spectrum activity. This collaboration will allow us to integrate computational predictions with biological validation, enhancing the potential for impactful scientific outcomes.
