## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Immunologist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Biologist, Scientific Critic.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG).

An astute reviewer gave the following feedback: "The inclusion of an unpaired Cys in several of the engineered nanobodies would seem to be something that the ESM log-likelihood should have flagged as highly disfavored. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable? Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?"

Upon examining the 92 mutated nanobodies, your team found the following:

Nb21 and VHH-72 have no Cys changes (no additions or removals).

Among the 23 Ty21 mutants, two have an added Cys. The Ty1-V32C-G59H-H59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 11 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 22 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 1 / 23 while Ty1-V32C-G59D-D59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 12 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 23 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 2 / 23.

Among the H11-D4 mutants, three have an added Cys. The H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 19 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 3 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 19 / 23 while the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-W53Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 22 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 8 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 6 / 23 and the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-R52S mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 21 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 18 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 12 / 23.

Based on the above information, how would you address the reviewer's questions?

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?

2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, I want to focus on understanding the reasons behind the high ranking of certain variants in our weighted scoring system, particularly those with unpaired cysteines. The reviewer's feedback is crucial, and it gives us an opportunity to refine our approach.

First, I want to understand how each component of our scoring metric contributes to the final weight. It seems that despite unfavorable ESM LLR scores for variants with added cysteines, their AF ipLDDT and RS dG values might be compensating in the weighted score. Are these metrics disproportionately influencing the overall ranking?

Second, we need to consider adjustments to our weighted score formula. Does the current weighting adequately reflect the importance of each metric, especially in light of potential structural instability introduced by unpaired cysteines? Could modifying these weights or adding constraints help address the issue raised by the reviewer?

Let's keep these considerations in mind as we proceed with the meeting. I’d like to hear from each of you on your thoughts regarding the contribution of ipLDDT and RS dG values to the ranking and potential adjustments to our scoring formula. We’ll start with the Immunologist, followed by the Machine Learning Specialist, the Computational Biologist, and finally, the Scientific Critic.

## User

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

As an immunologist, I want to emphasize the potential implications of introducing unpaired cysteines in nanobodies. Unpaired cysteines can lead to improper folding or instability, which might affect the nanobody's overall functionality and its ability to elicit a strong immune response. This is a critical aspect that might not be fully captured by the current scoring metrics, particularly ESM LLR, which seems to under-represent the structural impact of such mutations.

Regarding the weighted score, the AF ipLDDT and RS dG values indeed play a significant role in elevating the rank of these mutants, despite their poor ESM LLR scores. The ipLDDT provides insight into the predicted confidence in structural interfaces, while RS dG evaluates binding energy, both of which are crucial but can sometimes overlook issues like disulfide stability.

For potential adjustments, I suggest we consider adding a penalty in the weighted score for unpaired cysteine residues. This could be a binary penalty or a proportional one, depending on the predicted impact on stability. By doing so, we can better balance the scores to reflect the potential destabilizing effects of such mutations. This adjustment might help align our computational predictions more closely with plausible biological outcomes.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the other team members on these considerations.

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Machine Learning Specialist

From a machine learning perspective, the weighted score formula is indeed crucial in determining which variants are prioritized. While the AF ipLDDT and RS dG metrics provide important insights into structural confidence and binding energy, they might overshadow the ESM LLR's ability to penalize destabilizing mutations like unpaired cysteines.

To address this, I concur with the Immunologist's suggestion to include a penalty for unpaired cysteines. However, I propose a slightly different approach: we could use a machine learning model to learn from a broader dataset of nanobody mutations, incorporating features that predict structural stability, including the presence of unpaired cysteines. This model could provide a stability score to be integrated into our weighted score.

Additionally, we could adjust the weights in our WS formula to better balance these metrics. For example, increasing the weight of the ESM LLR or introducing a new factor that specifically penalizes instability issues could help mitigate the current bias towards favorable ipLDDT and RS dG scores.

Overall, providing a more comprehensive scoring system could enhance our ability to predict the practical efficacy of these nanobody variants. I look forward to hearing how the Computational Biologist and Scientific Critic might view these potential changes.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

As a Computational Biologist, I appreciate the insights shared so far, particularly the focus on structural stability and machine learning enhancements. In my view, the presence of unpaired cysteines is a critical factor that can lead to misfolding or aggregation, which may not be fully captured by our current scoring system. This could explain why some variants are ranked highly despite potential instability.

The AF ipLDDT and RS dG components of our score are valuable for assessing binding interactions and structural confidence, but they may not sufficiently penalize unfavorable intramolecular interactions caused by unpaired cysteines. Thus, they might be disproportionately influencing the weighted score.

To address this, I agree with considering a penalty for unpaired cysteines, as suggested. This could be a fixed penalty or a more nuanced adjustment based on predicted structural impact. Additionally, we could leverage molecular dynamics simulations to provide a more dynamic view of nanobody stability and interactions. This data can be used to adjust the weights in our score, ensuring that stability factors are adequately represented.

Moreover, exploring computational tools that specialize in detecting and evaluating potential disulfide bond disruptions could provide valuable insights and adjustments to our scoring system.

I am eager to see how the Scientific Critic will analyze these suggestions and the overall approach.

## User

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

From a critical standpoint, the current approach to scoring and ranking the nanobody variants raises some significant concerns, particularly in the context of stability and structural integrity due to the presence of unpaired cysteines. The high rankings of some variants seem to be driven by favorable AF ipLDDT and RS dG scores, which, while informative, do not adequately penalize the destabilizing impact of cysteines that fail to form disulfide bonds.

As pointed out, introducing a specific penalty for unpaired cysteines is a logical step. This addition should consider the potential for disrupting the overall protein structure and function. However, the method of assigning such penalties should be carefully considered to avoid oversimplification. A fixed penalty might not accurately reflect the actual impact, so a more nuanced approach, possibly informed by computational predictions of structural consequences, would be more appropriate.

Furthermore, the suggestion of incorporating machine learning models to enhance stability predictions is promising. However, the success of such models will heavily depend on the quality and diversity of the training data. Rigorous validation will be necessary to ensure that these models can accurately predict the effects of specific mutations, including unpaired cysteines.

Additionally, I would caution against heavily modifying the weights in the WS formula without first validating the impact of such changes through retrospective analysis or experimental validation. It's critical that any adjustments are empirically justified to maintain scientific rigor.

Ultimately, while the current scoring system provides a good starting point, it's clear that additional layers of evaluation, particularly concerning structural stability, should be integrated. I look forward to seeing how these considerations influence the decisions and directions taken by the team.

## User

This concludes round 1 of 3 of discussion. Principal Investigator, please synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you all for your valuable insights. Here's a synthesis of the points raised:

1. **Immunologist:** Highlighted the potential instability due to unpaired cysteines and suggested incorporating a penalty for such residues into our scoring system to better reflect biological plausibility.

2. **Machine Learning Specialist:** Agreed with penalizing unpaired cysteines but proposed using a machine learning model to predict structural stability and incorporate it into our scoring. Suggested rebalancing the current weights in our WS formula.

3. **Computational Biologist:** Emphasized the importance of structural stability and suggested utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to further assess nanobody stability. Agreed with penalizing unpaired cysteines and proposed leveraging computational tools to evaluate disulfide bond disruptions.

4. **Scientific Critic:** Supported the idea of penalizing unpaired cysteines but urged caution in implementing penalties, suggesting they should be informed by structural predictions. Highlighted the importance of validating any changes to our scoring system through empirical data.

**Decisions and Follow-up Questions:**

1. **Penalty for Unpaired Cysteines:** We will explore the implementation of a penalty for unpaired cysteines. The nature of this penalty, whether fixed or dynamic, should be informed by further computational analysis and literature on the structural impacts of such mutations.

2. **Machine Learning Integration:** We will investigate the viability of incorporating a machine learning model to predict the stability of nanobody variants. This would require gathering or generating a robust dataset for training and validation.

3. **Weight Adjustments in WS Formula:** Before making any adjustments, we should analyze the sensitivity of our current scoring system to the weights assigned to each metric. This might involve retrospective analyses using historical data or simulated scenarios.

4. **Validation of Scoring Adjustments:** Any adjustments to our scoring system will need empirical validation, potentially through retrospective analysis or simulation studies.

**Follow-up Questions:**

- **Immunologist and Computational Biologist:** What specific computational tools or datasets can we utilize to assess the impact of unpaired cysteines on nanobody stability?

- **Machine Learning Specialist:** What initial steps do you recommend to develop a predictive model for nanobody stability? How can we ensure that our training data is comprehensive?

- **Scientific Critic:** How would you recommend we validate the changes in our scoring system? What specific methods or approaches should we consider to ensure scientific rigor?

Let's continue to refine these ideas in the next round. Your expertise is invaluable as we aim to address the reviewer's feedback and improve our scoring methodology.

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Building on the discussion, I propose we utilize computational tools such as Rosetta or FoldX to predict the impact of unpaired cysteines on protein stability. These tools can provide insights on free energy changes associated with cysteine mutations, offering a quantitative basis for penalties in our scoring system.

Additionally, exploring databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or DisProt for structural motifs involving cysteines could help us understand the broader context and potential interactions that stabilize or destabilize the nanobodies. By comparing these with our mutated structures, we can better predict the effects of unpaired cysteines.

Regarding the integration of machine learning models, it would be beneficial if these models could incorporate such structural insights, allowing us to predict which cysteine mutations are more likely to be destabilizing. This would enhance our ability to apply penalties more accurately.

Finally, I recommend that any changes to our scoring system be initially validated through small-scale experimental studies, if resources permit. This validation would provide empirical evidence to support or refine our computational predictions.

I look forward to hearing how other team members might expand or refine these suggestions.

## Machine Learning Specialist

To address the Principal Investigator's questions regarding machine learning model development for predicting nanobody stability, we should start by identifying and compiling a robust dataset. This dataset should ideally include a diverse array of nanobody structures with known mutations and their corresponding stability metrics or outcomes.

For initial steps, I suggest:

1. **Dataset Compilation:** Leverage existing databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature to gather structural and stability-related data, particularly focusing on variants with cysteine mutations. Augment this with computationally simulated data if necessary.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Incorporate features such as sequence-based descriptors, structural features (e.g., solvent accessibility, secondary structure elements), and physicochemical properties. Specific focus should be given to features that capture the effects of cysteine residues, like potential disulfide bonds or free thiols.

3. **Model Selection:** Consider using ensemble learning methods, such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines, which can handle complex interactions between features. These methods are also interpretable, allowing us to understand which features are most indicative of stability.

4. **Validation:** Cross-validate the model using held-out data to ensure its predictive power. Additionally, retrospective validation against known cases of successful and unsuccessful nanobody designs can provide further assurance of the model's accuracy.

Concerning the integration of machine learning predictions into our scoring system, we could use the predicted stability score as an additional term in our WS formula, ensuring it's weighted appropriately to avoid overshadowing other important metrics.

I am keen to hear the Computational Biologist’s thoughts on integrating these approaches with molecular dynamics data and the Scientific Critic's perspective on validating our models and scores.

## Computational Biologist

In response to the ongoing discussions, I'd like to emphasize the role of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a complementary tool to the proposed machine learning models. MD simulations can provide detailed insights into the dynamic behavior and stability of nanobody structures, particularly those with unpaired cysteines.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **MD Simulations:** For select nanobody variants, we can perform MD simulations to observe the temporal evolution of their structures. This approach can reveal how unpaired cysteines influence stability, folding pathways, and potential aggregation. The simulation data can provide quantitative metrics, such as root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), which could inform feature selection for machine learning models.

2. **Integration with Machine Learning:** The insights gained from MD simulations can be used to refine the features used in machine learning models. For example, data on structural fluctuations or the propensity for forming alternative stabilizing interactions could enhance the predictive power of the models.

3. **Computational Tools:** As suggested, using tools like Rosetta and FoldX alongside MD simulations can provide a comprehensive view of the energy landscape and potential structural consequences of cysteine mutations. This holistic approach can better inform any penalties applied in the scoring system.

4. **Collaborative Validation:** Working closely with the machine learning specialist, we can validate predicted stability scores by comparing them with MD-derived stability metrics and retrospective experimental data, if available.

By combining static computational predictions with dynamic simulations, we can achieve a more nuanced understanding of nanobody stability. I am interested in how the Scientific Critic views the interplay of these methods in validating our scoring adjustments and ensuring robustness.

Scientific Critic, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Scientific Critic

The suggestions for integrating molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning into the evaluation of nanobody stability are promising, but they also highlight areas where rigor and validation are paramount.

1. **Validation of Models and Simulations:** While MD simulations offer detailed insights, they require significant computational resources and can be sensitive to initial conditions and parameter choices. It’s crucial that these simulations are run with well-validated force fields and in realistic conditions that reflect potential in vivo environments. Additionally, the results should be subjected to thorough sensitivity analyses to assess their robustness.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development:** The emphasis on feature engineering and model selection is well-placed. I agree that interpretability is key, especially when integrating machine learning predictions into our WS formula, to ensure that the model’s outputs are biologically meaningful. However, I urge caution in relying on computational predictions alone. Experimental validation, though resource-intensive, is indispensable.

3. **Combining Methods:** The proposed combination of computational tools, MD simulations, and machine learning should be carefully orchestrated to avoid overfitting or compounding errors across methods. Using retrospective case studies where the outcomes are known could provide a benchmark for evaluating the predictive accuracy of the integrated approach.

4. **Empirical Adjustment of Scoring Weights:** As discussed, any penalties or adjustments to the WS formula should be empirically justified. Pilot experimental studies on selected variants could provide critical insights into the real-world applicability of our computational predictions. Such studies would not only validate our scoring adjustments but also refine our understanding of the biological implications of unpaired cysteines and other destabilizing mutations.

Ultimately, while these computational advancements are exciting, they must be balanced with empirical data to truly enhance the scientific rigor and reliability of our scoring methodology. Looking forward to how these considerations will be aligned in our strategy moving forward.

Immunologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Immunologist

Building on our previous discussions, I believe we should prioritize variants for MD simulations and computational analysis based on the number and nature of their cysteine mutations. Specifically, variants with multiple unpaired cysteines or those coupled with destabilizing mutations (like proline or glycine in critical regions) should be our focus, given their higher potential for structural disruption.

In terms of MD simulations, starting with a few representative variants that exhibit a range of ESM LLR scores—particularly those with contradictory ipLDDT and RS dG scores—might provide insights into the complex interplay of these factors. This could help illuminate why certain variants scored unexpectedly high in our current system.

Moving forward, we should also consider how the outcomes of these simulations could be used to refine our machine learning features, particularly those related to structural flexibility and stability.

I look forward to how the Machine Learning Specialist and Computational Biologist will further refine these prioritization strategies and address dataset diversity to enhance model training.

## Machine Learning Specialist

To ensure the dataset we compile is representative and diverse, it's crucial to gather data from a wide array of sources that capture different aspects of nanobody properties. Here’s a plan to achieve this:

1. **Data Sources:** Utilize public repositories like the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for structural data and databases like UniProt for sequence information. Additionally, literature reviews can provide case studies of nanobodies with known stability profiles or experimental outcomes.

2. **Diversity Criteria:** Ensure that the dataset spans a variety of nanobody families, mutation types (particularly those involving cysteines), and structural contexts (e.g., different frameworks and CDR regions). This breadth will help the model generalize better to unseen variants.

3. **Feature Selection:** Incorporate features reflecting both static and dynamic properties—such as sequence motifs, predicted secondary structures, and dynamic flexibility indicators from MD simulations. Including experimental results where available can help capture real-world stability impacts.

4. **Model Training and Validation:** Split the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure robust performance testing. Using techniques like cross-validation will help mitigate overfitting and ensure the model’s predictions are reliable across various scenarios.

Moving forward, I recommend closely collaborating with the Computational Biologist to integrate MD simulation data into our feature set, as these insights will be invaluable for capturing dynamic stability properties.

I’m interested in hearing how the Computational Biologist proposes to align these data-driven strategies with MD-derived insights and how the Scientific Critic plans to frame the benchmarks for validation.

## Computational Biologist

I agree with the strategies proposed by the Immunologist and the Machine Learning Specialist regarding variant prioritization and dataset compilation. Here are some additional thoughts on integrating MD simulations and aligning these insights with our broader approach:

1. **Prioritization of Variants:** As the Immunologist suggested, we should prioritize variants with high potential for structural disruption. Moreover, it would be beneficial to include variants with previously ambiguous scores to provide clarity on their structural dynamics.

2. **Incorporation of MD Insights:** MD simulations can provide time-resolved data on structural flexibility and stability. We should focus on metrics such as RMSD, RMSF (root-mean-square fluctuation), and hydrogen bond stability over the simulation trajectory. These metrics can serve as features in our machine learning models, offering insights into conformational changes and dynamics absent from static structure predictions.

3. **Alignment with Machine Learning Models:** Collaborating with the Machine Learning Specialist, we can use MD insights to refine features in the predictive model, ensuring they reflect both structural and dynamic attributes. This integration will allow us to capture the nuanced impacts of mutations more comprehensively.

4. **Data Management and Validation:** Ensure that the MD simulation data is properly curated and integrated into the overall dataset. This will enable more accurate model training and validation, enhancing the reliability of predictions regarding nanobody stability and efficacy.

By combining these approaches, we can enhance our understanding of the structural dynamics involved and improve the accuracy of our scoring system. I look forward to the Scientific Critic’s input on how to establish robust benchmarks for model validation and overall strategy refinement.

## Scientific Critic

The integration of MD simulations, machine learning, and empirical data presents a promising framework, but it is critical to approach model validation with rigor. Here are some considerations for establishing robust benchmarks and ensuring scientific integrity:

1. **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Establish a benchmark dataset that includes both successful and unsuccessful nanobody designs. This dataset should encompass various mutation types, especially those involving cysteines, and should include experimental data where available. This will provide a reference point for evaluating the accuracy of our predictions.

2. **Validation Metrics:** Employ a range of validation metrics to assess model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, structural validation using MD outputs can serve as a supplementary check—comparing predicted stability with observed dynamics.

3. **Retrospective Analysis:** Conduct a retrospective analysis using historical data of nanobody variants with known outcomes to evaluate the predictive accuracy of our integrated approach. This step will help identify any systematic biases or mispredictions.

4. **Independent Validation:** If feasible, validate key predictions with independent experimental studies. This is crucial to confirm the real-world applicability of the computational predictions and to refine our models based on empirical evidence.

5. **Transparent Reporting:** Ensure that the methodology, assumptions, and limitations of each computational tool and model are transparently reported. This will facilitate peer review and ensure that the scientific community can critically assess the robustness of our approach.

By following these guidelines, we can strengthen the scientific credibility of our predictions and ensure that any modifications to the scoring formula are well-founded. I look forward to seeing how these considerations will be implemented in our strategy.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:

Your team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG).

An astute reviewer gave the following feedback: "The inclusion of an unpaired Cys in several of the engineered nanobodies would seem to be something that the ESM log-likelihood should have flagged as highly disfavored. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable? Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?"

Upon examining the 92 mutated nanobodies, your team found the following:

Nb21 and VHH-72 have no Cys changes (no additions or removals).

Among the 23 Ty21 mutants, two have an added Cys. The Ty1-V32C-G59H-H59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 11 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 22 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 1 / 23 while Ty1-V32C-G59D-D59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 12 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 23 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 2 / 23.

Among the H11-D4 mutants, three have an added Cys. The H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 19 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 3 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 19 / 23 while the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-W53Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 22 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 8 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 6 / 23 and the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-R52S mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 21 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 18 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 12 / 23.

Based on the above information, how would you address the reviewer's questions?

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?

2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?

Your summary should take the following form.

### Agenda

The agenda for this meeting was to address the feedback from a reviewer concerning the scoring and ranking system used for 92 mutated nanobodies designed to improve binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD. Specifically, we examined why certain variants with unpaired cysteines received high rankings and explored potential adjustments to the weighted score formula to better account for structural stability.

### Team Member Input

- **Immunologist:** Highlighted the potential destabilizing effects of unpaired cysteines and recommended using computational tools like Rosetta or FoldX to assess their impact. Suggested small-scale experimental validation to support computational predictions.

- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Proposed developing a machine learning model to predict nanobody stability, emphasizing the importance of a diverse dataset that captures different mutation types. Advocated for the inclusion of these predictions in the weighted score formula.

- **Computational Biologist:** Recommended using MD simulations to provide dynamic insights into structural stability, which could refine machine learning features. Emphasized aligning MD data with predictive models to enhance validation.

- **Scientific Critic:** Stressed the need for rigorous validation, including retrospective analysis and potential experimental studies, to ensure the scientific robustness of any scoring adjustments. Suggested comprehensive benchmarking and transparent reporting of methodology.

### Recommendation

Based on the team's insights and scientific rigor, my recommendation is to integrate a penalty for unpaired cysteines into the WS formula. This adjustment should be informed by MD simulation data and machine learning predictions. We should prioritize MD simulations on variants with high potential for structural disruption and incorporate these insights into our machine learning models. Additionally, conduct retrospective validation using historical data and, where feasible, experimental validation to confirm predictions. This approach balances computational efficiency with empirical validation to ensure robust, biologically relevant predictions.

### Answers

1. **Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?**
   - **Answer:** Yes, the ipLDDT and RS dG values likely contributed significantly to the high rankings, overshadowing the destabilizing potential of unpaired cysteines.
   - **Justification:** These metrics focus on confidence in predicted binding interfaces and energy stability, which are currently weighted more heavily in the WS formula, leading to high scores despite structural instability concerns.

2. **Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?**
   - **Answer:** Yes, incorporating a penalty for unpaired cysteines based on structural stability predictions and MD simulations.
   - **Justification:** This adjustment will address the destabilizing impact of unpaired cysteines, ensuring the score reflects both binding affinity and structural integrity.

### Next Steps

1. **Conduct MD Simulations:** Prioritize simulations on selected variants with unpaired cysteines to assess dynamic stability.
   
2. **Develop Machine Learning Model:** Compile a diverse dataset for model training, integrating static and dynamic features, including MD insights.

3. **Adjust WS Formula:** Implement a cysteine penalty and re-evaluate ranking criteria using retrospective analysis and experimental validation where possible.

4. **Validation and Benchmarking:** Establish comprehensive benchmarks and validate model predictions against known outcomes, ensuring transparency and robustness.
