We aimed to understand if structural predictions or binding energies were skewing the results, and to identify potential adjustments to our weighted scoring formula to more accurately reflect the biological viability of these variants.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n- **Immunologist:** Highlighted the potential instability and immunogenicity issues that unpaired cysteines might introduce. Suggested implementing a penalty in the WS formula and recommended using PBMCs for immunogenicity testing.\n\n- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Discussed the limitations of current ML models in flagging unpaired cysteines. Proposed retraining models with cysteine-specific data and incorporating penalties for structural anomalies into the WS formula.\n\n- **Computational Biologist:** Proposed using molecular dynamics simulations to assess nanobody stability over time, suggesting a timeline for preparation, execution, and analysis phases. Emphasized integrating these results with experimental validation.\n\n- **Scientific Critic:** Recommended prioritizing experimental validations, especially stability and binding assays, to empirically validate computational predictions. Suggested a feedback loop for continuous model refinement based on experimental outcomes.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nBased on the team's input, my expert recommendation is to:\n\n1. **Refine the Weighted Score Formula:** Introduce a penalty for unpaired cysteines within the WS formula. This penalty should be dynamically assessed, perhaps using machine learning models trained specifically to recognize such structural anomalies.\n\n2. **Conduct Comprehensive Experimental Validation:** Prioritize variants with high binding scores but potential structural issues for experimental validation. Use in vitro assays to assess stability and binding, and incorporate immunogenicity testing in human cell models.\n\n3. **Integrate Molecular Dynamics Simulations:** Use MD simulations to provide dynamic insights into nanobody stability, focusing on variants where computational predictions suggest discrepancies.\n\nThis approach balances computational predictions with empirical data, ensuring that our scoring system reflects the true biological potential of the variants.\n\n### Answers\n\n**1. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?**\n\n- **Answer:** Yes, the ipLDDT and RS dG values likely contributed to the high rankings despite unfavorable ESM LLR scores.\n- **Justification:** The high confidence in predicted structure and binding affinity could overshadow sequence-based concerns, leading to a skewed ranking of variants with unpaired cysteines.\n\n**2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?**\n\n- **Answer:** Yes, introduce a penalty for unpaired cysteines and adjust weightings to better balance sequence and structure-based evaluations.\n- **Justification:** This adjustment will ensure that structural instability related to unpaired cysteines is accounted for, preventing false positives in our rankings.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Develop and Test WS Formula Adjustments:** Implement the proposed penalty for unpaired cysteines and test the impact of these changes on the ranking of variants.\n\n2. **Retrain ML Models:** Begin data collection and preprocessing for cysteine-specific model training to improve prediction accuracy.\n\n3. **Conduct MD Simulations:** Initiate MD simulations for selected variants to provide dynamic stability insights.\n\n4. **Plan and Execute Experimental Validations:** Design and prioritize binding, stability, and immunogenicity assays to validate the computational predictions.\n\nBy following these steps, we will strengthen our scoring approach and ensure the selection of nanobodies with true potential for effective binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD.\n\n[end summary 1]\n\n[begin summary 2]\n\n### Agenda\n\nThe agenda focuses on evaluating and potentially adjusting our weighted scoring (WS) formula used to rank mutated nanobodies designed to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD. Specifically, we need to address feedback regarding the inclusion of unpaired cysteines in some engineered nanobodies and understand why these variants rank highly despite potential destabilizing effects. We will also explore adjustments to the WS formula to mitigate any biases introduced by favorable structural and binding energy scores.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n- **Immunologist**: Emphasized the potential stability issues and immunogenicity concerns due to unpaired cysteines. Suggested implementing a penalty in the WS formula proportional to the number of unpaired cysteines.

Suggested criteria for selecting variants for simulation and emphasized aligning computational efforts with experimental priorities.\n\n- **Scientific Critic**: Stressed the importance of transparency and clarity in process adjustments and documentation. Proposed establishing clear metrics for success and ensuring that model and scoring changes remain interpretable and actionable.\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Recommendation**: Adjust the WS formula to include a penalty for unpaired cysteines, initially set at a 5-10% reduction per unpaired cysteine, subject to iterative refinement based on experimental data. Develop a supplementary model to detect unpaired cysteines, focusing on a quick deployment strategy using existing datasets. Prioritize experimental assays to validate stability and binding, aligning these efforts with computational predictions through regular feedback loops.\n\n**Justification**: This approach balances the need for immediate action to address the reviewer's feedback with the longer-term goal of refining our models and predictions. By integrating penalties for unpaired cysteines, we account for potential stability and immunogenicity concerns while maintaining the integrity of our ranking system. The iterative feedback loop ensures that both computational and experimental insights continuously inform each other, leading to a robust and data-driven refinement process.\n\n### Answers\n\n**1. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?**\n\n- **Answer**: Yes, the high ipLDDT and favorable RS dG scores can lead to high rankings despite ESM LLR not flagging unpaired cysteines. These metrics reflect structural confidence and binding energy, which can outweigh sequence-based concerns in the current WS formula.\n\n- **Justification**: The existing WS formula heavily weights structural and energetic metrics, which can overshadow sequence-level disruptions, such as unpaired cysteines. This indicates a need for balance in the scoring system.\n\n**2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?**\n\n- **Answer**: Introduce a penalty for unpaired cysteines in the WS formula to account for potential stability and immunogenicity issues, thus mitigating the influence of overly favorable structural and binding energy scores alone.\n\n- **Justification**: A penalty directly addresses the core issue of unpaired cysteines that the ESM LLR might not adequately capture, providing a more balanced and realistic assessment of nanobody viability.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Implement the WS Penalty**: Adjust the WS formula to include a penalty for unpaired cysteines, starting with a 5-10% reduction per cysteine, and test the impact on rankings.\n   \n2. **Develop the Supplementary Model**: Begin development of a supplementary model to enhance detection of unpaired cysteines, using existing datasets for quick deployment.\n   \n3. **Conduct Experimental Assays**: Prioritize thermal stability and binding assays for top-ranked variants, focusing on those with unpaired cysteines, and use these results to refine the WS formula.\n   \n4. **Run Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Select specific variants for molecular dynamics simulations to further validate structural predictions and binding interactions.\n   \n5. **Establish Iterative Feedback Loop**: Create a process for regular review and integration of computational and experimental findings, refining models and scoring criteria as needed.\n\n[end summary 2]\n\n[begin summary 3]\n\n### Agenda\n\nOur goal is to address the concerns raised by a reviewer regarding the high ranking of nanobody variants with unpaired cysteines, despite potential structural instabilities. Specifically, we need to understand why these variants are ranked highly and consider adjustments to the weighted scoring formula (WS) to better reflect potential liabilities.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n- **Immunologist:** Highlighted the potential structural instability of unpaired cysteines and suggested increasing the weight of ESM LLR or introducing a specific penalty for unpaired cysteines to address these concerns.\n  \n- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Recommended feature engineering to include structural liabilities and using ensemble methods to integrate these features.

Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.\n\nAs a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:\n\nYour team has designed 92 mutated nanobodies (23 each for the wild-type nanobodies H11-D4, Nb21, Ty1, and VHH-72) to improve their binding to the KP.3 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Each nanobody has 1-4 mutations relative to the wild-type nanobody. Your team used ESM log-likelihood ratios (ESM LLR) to score the nanobody mutations independent of the antigen, AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD and compute the interface pLDDT (AF ipLDDT) as a metric of binding confidence, and Rosetta to calculate the binding energy of the mutated nanobody in complex with the KP.3 RBD (RS dG) based on the AlphaFold-Multimer predicted structure followed by a Rosetta relaxation. You have ranked the mutant nanobodies and selected the top ones using a weighted score of WS = 0.2 * (ESM LLR) + 0.5 * (AF ipLDDT) - 0. 3 * (RS dG).\n\nAn astute reviewer gave the following feedback: \"The inclusion of an unpaired Cys in several of the engineered nanobodies would seem to be something that the ESM log-likelihood should have flagged as highly disfavored. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable? Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?\"\n\nUpon examining the 92 mutated nanobodies, your team found the following:\n\nNb21 and VHH-72 have no Cys changes (no additions or removals).\n\nAmong the 23 Ty21 mutants, two have an added Cys. The Ty1-V32C-G59H-H59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 11 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 22 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 1 / 23 while Ty1-V32C-G59D-D59Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 12 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 23 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 2 / 23.\n\nAmong the H11-D4 mutants, three have an added Cys. The H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 19 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 3 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 19 / 23 while the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-W53Y mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 22 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 8 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 6 / 23 and the H11-D4-A14P-Y88V-R27C-R52S mutant has an ESM LLR rank of 21 / 23, an AF ipLDDT rank of 18 / 23, and an RS DG rank of 12 / 23.\n\nBased on the above information, how would you address the reviewer's questions?\n\nAs a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:\n\n1. Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?\n\n2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."

Is there some other reason why the weighted score would rank these variants so highly, like the ipLDDT or dG values being very favorable?**\n\n- **Answer:** Yes, the high ipLDDT and RS dG values are likely contributing significantly to the high rankings of these variants, despite the presence of unpaired cysteines.\n- **Justification:** The ipLDDT and RS dG metrics are heavily weighted in the current WS formula, reflecting strong structural confidence and favorable binding energies. These metrics can overshadow sequence-based concerns, such as the presence of unpaired cysteines, leading to high rankings for variants that might otherwise be considered structurally unstable. The current weighting prioritizes structural predictions and binding affinity, which are critical for initial assessments of nanobody efficacy.\n\n**2. Are there any obvious adjustments to the WS formula that could mitigate this?**\n\n- **Answer:** Yes, introducing a penalty for unpaired cysteines in the WS formula could mitigate this issue.\n- **Justification:** Incorporating a penalty for unpaired cysteines will help balance the scoring system by accounting for potential structural instability and immunogenicity concerns. This adjustment ensures that the scoring reflects both binding affinity and structural integrity, providing a more accurate assessment of nanobody viability.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n- **Penalty Quantification:** Implement a penalty of 5-10% reduction in the WS score per unpaired cysteine. This range is based on preliminary retrospective analysis of similar structural disruptions in protein engineering literature, which suggests that unpaired cysteines can significantly impact protein stability.\n\n- **Testing and Validation:** Use molecular dynamics simulations to assess the dynamic stability of nanobody variants with unpaired cysteines. This data will inform the penalty's magnitude and ensure it accurately reflects structural liabilities.\n\n- **Empirical Validation:** Conduct thermal stability tests and binding assays to validate the computational predictions. These experiments will provide empirical data to support or refine the penalty approach.\n\n- **Integration of Computational Tools:** Leverage tools like FoldX and Rosetta for initial stability assessments, followed by detailed molecular dynamics simulations for selected variants. This integration will provide comprehensive insights into the structural implications of unpaired cysteines.\n\n- **Metric Weighting Adjustments:** Consider adjusting the weightings of ipLDDT and RS dG in the WS formula to ensure that the introduction of the penalty does not disproportionately affect the overall scoring. This adjustment will be based on the outcomes of the penalty implementation and empirical validations.\n\n- **Timeline and Resources:** \n  - **Timeline:** Aim to complete the initial penalty implementation and computational assessments within the next 3 months. Empirical validations will follow, with expected completion within 6 months.\n  - **Resources:** Allocate additional computational resources for molecular dynamics simulations and collaborate with experimental labs for empirical testing. Ensure that team members are aligned on priorities and timelines.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy implementing these detailed adjustments and validation steps, we can address the reviewer's concerns more effectively. This approach ensures that our scoring system accurately reflects the biological potential of the nanobody variants, balancing computational predictions with empirical validation."
