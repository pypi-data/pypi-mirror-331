Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

As we begin our discussion, it's important to consider both the scientific and strategic aspects of our project. Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our conversation:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies**: We need to weigh the advantages of using standard antibodies against nanobodies. While antibodies have a long history of therapeutic use, nanobodies offer unique benefits such as smaller size, better tissue penetration, and greater stability. Consider which characteristics are most critical for our project’s success.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modification**: If we choose to modify existing antibodies or nanobodies, we should focus on those with proven efficacy against previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, a de novo approach could enable us to tailor our design specifically for the newest variant. We need to explore which approach aligns best with our timeline, resources, and goals.

3. **Selection of Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies**: If we decide to modify existing ones, identifying 3-4 candidates with strong neutralizing capabilities against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial. What criteria should we use for selection, and what are some known candidates that could serve as a starting point?

4. **Proposing De Novo Candidates**: How can we leverage machine learning to design new candidates? Should we use specific algorithms or databases, and how would we validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs?

As we go through the discussion, please consider:
- The scientific rationale behind your preference.
- Any potential challenges or limitations of your preferred approach.
- How machine learning can uniquely contribute to our project’s success.

I look forward to each team member’s insights on these points. Let's proceed with Assistant 1 sharing their thoughts.
