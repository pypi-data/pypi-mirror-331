Assistant Lead, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Assistant Lead

Thank you for joining the meeting, everyone. We have an important task to tackle regarding our research project on developing antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our goal today is to decide on our design approach, specifically focusing on the agenda questions.

Here are my initial thoughts and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies:** 
   - Nanobodies have a smaller size, which might allow for better tissue penetration and stability. However, we need to consider their production and efficacy compared to standard antibodies. What are your views on the advantages and disadvantages of each option?

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies:**
   - Designing de novo allows for high specificity and novel mechanisms, but it might be time-consuming and less certain. Modifying existing antibodies/nanobodies could be a faster route, leveraging known efficacy and safety profiles. How do we balance these considerations?

3. **If Modifying Existing Options:**
   - Identifying 3-4 existing antibodies/nanobodies that are strong candidates is crucial. Which existing antibodies/nanobodies do you consider as promising starting points for modification, and why?

4. **If Designing De Novo:**
   - How can we leverage machine learning to identify promising candidates? What strategies or approaches should we employ to ensure a successful design process?

Let's hear from each team member, starting with Assistant 1, regarding your insights on these points. After everyone has shared their thoughts, I'll synthesize your input and we can move to the next round of discussions.

Assistant 1, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Assistant 1

Thank you, Assistant Lead. Here are my thoughts on the agenda items:

1. **Antibodies vs. Nanobodies:** I lean towards nanobodies for this project. Their smaller size can facilitate better tissue penetration and potentially offer more stability, which could be advantageous given the variability in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, they can be produced rapidly in microbial systems, which might expedite our timelines.

2. **De Novo Design vs. Modifying Existing Antibodies/Nanobodies:** I think modifying existing nanobodies is a more pragmatic approach. We already have a wealth of data on existing nanobodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can inform our modifications to improve their breadth and efficacy against new and minor variants.

3. **Existing Candidates for Modification:** I suggest starting with nanobodies such as Ty1, H11-H4, and Nb21. These have shown efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants and could serve as robust templates for engineering broader activity.

4. **If Designing De Novo:** While I favor modification, if we were to explore de novo design, leveraging machine learning models trained on structural and sequence data of known spike protein interactions could help generate promising candidates.

I look forward to hearing the rest of the team's input on these points.
