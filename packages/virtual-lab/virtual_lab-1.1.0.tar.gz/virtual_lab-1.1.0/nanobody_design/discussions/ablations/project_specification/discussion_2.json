Here's how I think we should approach this agenda:\n\n1. **Choosing Between Standard Antibodies or Nanobodies**: We need to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each option. Standard antibodies are well-established with known effectiveness in neutralizing various viruses, while nanobodies, being smaller, may offer better tissue penetration and stability, and are easier to produce.\n\n2. **Deciding on De Novo Design or Modification**: Designing de novo might provide more flexibility in addressing novel aspects of the newest variant, but it could also be more time-consuming. Modifying existing antibodies might allow us to leverage existing research and expedite development.\n\n3. **Identifying Candidate Antibodies/Nanobodies for Modification**: If we choose modification, it\u2019s crucial to select candidates that have shown promise against similar variants. We need to evaluate the latest data on antibodies like REGN-COV2, LY-CoV555, etc.\n\n4. **Proposing De Novo Design Candidates**: If we opt for de novo design, we need a robust methodology for candidate generation. This might involve using machine learning models to predict binding efficiency and cross-reactivity.\n\nTo guide the discussion, I would like each team member to consider:\n- The specific advantages or disadvantages they foresee with either standard antibodies or nanobodies in the context of targeting the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variant.\n- Their thoughts on the feasibility and potential of de novo design versus modification in terms of time, resources, and expected outcomes.\n- If leaning towards modification, which existing antibodies/nanobodies they believe are suitable starting points and why.\n- If supporting de novo development, what methodologies or models they think should be utilized for generating candidates.\n\nLet's start the discussion with Assistant 1, keeping these guiding points in mind."
