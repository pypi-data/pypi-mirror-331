This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here are summaries of the previous meetings:

[begin summary 1]

To efficiently use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in our iterative nanobody design process, I propose the following approach:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **Step 1: ESM Evaluation** - First, use ESM to quickly evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the nanobody. This will help us identify promising candidates for further evaluation.
- **Step 2: AlphaFold-Multimer Evaluation** - Run AlphaFold-Multimer on a selected subset of mutations based on their ESM scores. This step will predict the nanobody-antigen structure for further analysis.
- **Step 3: Rosetta Evaluation** - Finally, use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the nanobody-antigen complex based on the structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 2. Number of Mutations to Evaluate
- **ESM**: Evaluate all potential single-point mutations in the nanobody sequence using ESM. The actual number of mutations will depend on the length of the nanobody.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer**: Select the top 10 mutations (based on ESM scores) for evaluation with AlphaFold-Multimer. This is a balance between computational resources and the need for detailed structural predictions.
- **Rosetta**: Evaluate the Rosetta binding energy for the same 10 mutations processed by AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 3. Scoring Formula and Ranking
At the end of each iteration, mutations will be ranked using a weighted scoring system that combines outputs from ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta:
- **Combined Score = w1 * ESM_score + w2 * (AlphaFold-Multimer_score) - w3 * (|Rosetta_score|)**
  
Here, \(w1\), \(w2\), and \(w3\) are weights that should be chosen to reflect the relative importance of each score. A potential starting point could be equal weighting (e.g., \(w1 = w2 = w3 = 1/3\)), which can be adjusted based on preliminary results or domain expertise.

### 4. Number of Mutations to Keep
- Keep the top 5 ranked mutations based on the combined score for the next round of mutations. This allows for a manageable number of candidates while still exploring a broad sequence space.

### 5. Deciding on the Number of Iterations
- The number of iterations will depend on the convergence of scores and available computational resources. A reasonable target would be 4-6 iterations, allowing us to explore a substantial portion of the mutation space while keeping within time constraints.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies
- **Step 1**: After all iterations, compile a list of all evaluated mutations and their scores.
- **Step 2**: Rank all mutations using the same scoring formula.
- **Step 3**: Select the top 24 mutations with the highest combined scores for experimental validation, ensuring diversity in terms of mutation sites to maximize the chance of broad neutralization across variants.

This strategic approach leverages the strengths of each tool while managing computational resources effectively, ensuring that we can identify promising nanobody candidates within the project timeline.

[begin summary 2]

To effectively use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in the iterative design process for developing nanobodies, here are the answers to the agenda questions:

1. **Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations:**
   - First, run ESM to evaluate all potential mutations. ESM is fast and can evaluate all mutations in 5 minutes, providing an initial filter based on the log-likelihood ratios.
   - Next, select a subset of top mutations from ESM to evaluate using AlphaFold-Multimer. This step refines the selection by modeling the nanobody-antigen complex and providing pLDDT scores.
   - Finally, after obtaining the structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer, run Rosetta on these selected mutations to calculate binding energy scores, as Rosetta requires the structural output from AlphaFold-Multimer.

2. **Number of Mutations to Evaluate:**
   - Evaluate all potential mutations with ESM. 
   - For AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta, evaluate a manageable subset from the top ESM-ranked mutations, e.g., around 50 mutations per iteration, balancing computational time and resources.

3. **Weighing the Scores to Rank Mutations:**
   - After evaluating a mutation with all three tools, use a weighted scoring formula to rank them. For instance:
     \[
     \text{Overall Score} = w_1 \times (\text{ESM score}) + w_2 \times (\text{AlphaFold-Multimer pLDDT score}) - w_3 \times (\text{Rosetta binding energy score})
     \]
   - Assign weights based on the importance of each factor: \(w_1 = 0.2\), \(w_2 = 0.5\), and \(w_3 = 0.3\), adjusting as necessary based on specific goals (e.g., structural stability versus binding affinity).

4. **Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep:**
   - Keep approximately the top 10 mutations from each iteration for further consideration, ensuring a focused yet diverse set of promising candidates for subsequent iterations.

5. **Deciding Number of Iterations:**
   - Plan for approximately 3 to 4 iterations, allowing for refinement of nanobody candidates while maintaining a practical timeline. Adjust the number of iterations based on observed convergence of scores or resource availability.

6. **Selection of Final Nanobodies for Experimental Validation:**
   - At the end of all iterations:
     1. Compile the top-ranked mutations from each iteration based on the overall score.
     2. Evaluate the diversity of the selected mutations to ensure coverage of different binding characteristics.
     3. Select 24 final nanobody variants that represent a balance of top scores, diversity in mutation profiles, and computational resource efficiency.
     4. Confirm the final selection with domain experts and align with the overarching research goals.
     5. Prepare selected nanobodies for experimental validation, considering logistic and experimental constraints.

This strategy ensures a systematic approach to refining nanobody design through iterative computational analysis, balancing speed, accuracy, and resource allocation.

[begin summary 3]

To effectively design modified nanobodies with enhanced binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we will implement a structured iterative design process leveraging ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta. Here's a detailed response to the agenda questions:

1. **Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations:**
   - **Step 1:** Use ESM to evaluate all potential single-point mutations to the existing nanobody. This step rapidly assesses the likelihood of beneficial mutations.
   - **Step 2:** Select the top mutations according to ESM scores for further evaluation.
   - **Step 3:** For each selected mutation, use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure.
   - **Step 4:** Use Rosetta to evaluate the binding energy of the predicted structures from AlphaFold-Multimer.

2. **Number of Mutations to Evaluate:**
   - **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-point mutations in the nanobody (typically 20 mutations per position).
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta:** Due to time constraints, select the top 10 mutations from ESM to evaluate further.

3. **Formula to Rank Mutations:**
   - Combine the scores as follows to rank mutations:
     \[
     \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{ESM log-likelihood ratio} + w_2 \times \text{AlphaFold-Multimer interface pLDDT} - w_3 \times \text{Rosetta binding energy}
     \]
   - Choose weights \(w_1\), \(w_2\), and \(w_3\) based on their relative importance decided through initial testing or literature values. For example, \(w_1 = 0.2\), \(w_2 = 0.4\), \(w_3 = 0.4\).

4. **Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep:**
   - Retain the top 5 mutations in each iteration to ensure diversity and potential improvement in subsequent rounds.

5. **Deciding the Number of Iterations:**
   - Continue the iterative process until convergence, defined by a plateau in improvement of scores or up to a maximum of 5 iterations, balancing time constraints and diversity exploration.

6. **Selection of the Final 24 Modified Nanobodies:**
   - **Step 1:** Compile all top mutations from each iteration.
   - **Step 2:** Rank these mutations using the combined score formula.
   - **Step 3:** Select the top 24 unique nanobody sequences, ensuring diversity by selecting different mutation sites whenever possible.
   - **Step 4:** Use domain expertise to further refine this list, considering potential cross-reactivity and structural integrity.
   - **Step 5:** Validate these computer-generated designs experimentally to confirm enhanced binding across variants.

By following this strategic plan, we aim to efficiently explore the mutational landscape to identify nanobodies with improved binding to the new SARS-CoV-2 variant.

[end summary 3]

[begin summary 4]

To address the agenda for our research project on designing improved nanobodies for the newest SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant, let's consider each question in turn:

1. **Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations:**

   - **Step 1:** Use ESM to rapidly evaluate all possible mutations to the starting nanobody to filter down to a manageable number of promising mutations.
   - **Step 2:** For the top mutations identified by ESM, use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the nanobody-antigen complex structure, as this step is computationally intensive and must be done before Rosetta.
   - **Step 3:** Use Rosetta to score the predicted structures from AlphaFold-Multimer to evaluate binding energy.

2. **Number of Mutations Evaluated:**

   - **ESM:** Evaluate all possible single-residue mutations in one go due to its rapid evaluation time.
   - **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta:** Given the time constraint, evaluate around 20-30 top mutations per iteration after filtering with ESM.

3. **Weighing the Scores to Rank Mutations:**

   Given the different scoring ranges and objectives:
   
   - **Formula:** 
     \[
     C_{\text{total}} = w_{\text{ESM}} \times \text{LLR}_{\text{ESM}} + w_{\text{AF}} \times \text{pLDDT}_{\text{AF}} - w_{\text{Rosetta}} \times \text{Binding Energy}_{\text{Rosetta}}
     \]
   
   Where \( w_{\text{ESM}}, w_{\text{AF}}, \) and \( w_{\text{Rosetta}} \) are weights assigned to balance the influence of each score. Initially, consider setting these weights to normalize the score contributions (e.g., 0.3, 0.3, 0.3) depending on their typical ranges and importance.

4. **Number of Top-Ranked Mutations to Keep:**

   - Keep around 5-10 top-ranked mutations for the next round of iterative design, ensuring diversity in locations and characteristics of mutations.

5. **Deciding the Number of Iterations:**

   - Plan for 3-4 iterations initially, evaluating the improvement in scores and diversity of binding pocket interactions. Stop if the improvement plateaus or if time/resources become constrained.

6. **Selecting the Final Set of 24 Modified Nanobodies:**

   - **Step 1:** Compile mutations from all iterations and rank them using the weighted score formula.
   - **Step 2:** Ensure structural diversity by clustering mutations based on their location and type, ensuring not all selected modifications are overly similar.
   - **Step 3:** Select the top-ranked nanobodies from each cluster to achieve a final set of 24 modified nanobodies.
   - **Step 4:** Conduct a final review of scores to ensure the chosen set represents the best trade-off between binding affinity enhancement and structural variability.

The outlined plan will help us efficiently navigate the computational pipeline within the time constraints, while maximizing the likelihood of developing broadly effective nanobodies against the new SARS-CoV-2 variant, suitable for experimental validation.

[end summary 4]

[begin summary 5]

To address the agenda for our research project on developing modified nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, I propose the following plan:

### 1. Order of Operations for Evaluating Mutations
In each iteration, the order of operations will be:
- **ESM**: First, evaluate all potential mutations for a nanobody using ESM to quickly narrow down the most promising candidates. This step is computationally efficient and will take a total of 5 minutes for all mutations.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer**: After filtering the mutations based on ESM scores, use AlphaFold-Multimer to predict the structure of the top-ranked mutations. This provides detailed structural insights necessary for subsequent steps.
- **Rosetta**: Finally, use Rosetta on the structures predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer to evaluate the binding energy of the mutations.

### 2. Number of Mutations Evaluated
- **ESM**: Evaluate all possible mutations (potentially hundreds depending on the size of the nanobody) in each iteration.
- **AlphaFold-Multimer and Rosetta**: Due to time constraints, evaluate the top 20 mutations from the ESM step using AlphaFold-Multimer. Then, evaluate all 20 with Rosetta using the structures from AlphaFold-Multimer.

### 3. Weighing the Scores to Rank Mutations
To rank the nanobody mutations, combine the scores from ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta using the following formula:
\[ \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{(ESM Log-Likelihood Ratio)} + w_2 \times \text{(AlphaFold-Multimer Interface pLDDT)} - w_3 \times \text{(Rosetta Binding Energy)} \]
Where \( w_1, w_2, \) and \( w_3 \) are weights that can be tuned based on empirical testing, with an initial suggestion of \( w_1 = 0.2, w_2 = 0.5, \) and \( w_3 = 0.3 \).

### 4. Number of Top-Ranked Mutations Kept
Keep the top 5 mutations from each iteration to carry forward into the next round of iterations.

### 5. Deciding Number of Iterations
Plan to run the process for up to 4 iterations, allowing for sufficient exploration of the sequence space while staying within time constraints. Monitor convergence of scores and diversity of mutations; if improvements plateau or all mutations appear similar, consider stopping early.

### 6. Selecting the Final Set of Modified Nanobodies
After completing all iterations:
- Collect all top mutations from each round.
- Rank all mutations from all iterations based on the combined score.
- Select the top 24 unique mutations with the highest scores, ensuring coverage of diverse mutational profiles to enhance potential cross-variant activity.
- If there are ties or close scores, prioritize based on diversity of sequences to ensure broad coverage of the mutational landscape.

This plan balances computational efficiency with scientific rigor, ensuring that we can effectively identify promising nanobody candidates within our constraints. Let me know if there are any questions or further adjustments needed.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Please read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Your team has built three components of a nanobody design pipeline: ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta. Each of these three tools can be used to score a nanobody mutation based on how the mutation affects binding to an antigen. Your goal is to start with an existing nanobody and iteratively add mutations to it to improve its binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in 24 modified nanobodies with one or more mutations. Please determine how to use ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta in this iterative design process. An important constraint is that ESM can evaluate all potential mutations to a nanobody in 5 minutes while AlphaFold-Multimer takes 30 minutes per mutation and Rosetta takes five minutes per mutation. The whole iterative process should take no more than a few days to complete. Note that AlphaFold-Multimer must be run before Rosetta on each mutation since Rosetta requires the nanobody-antigen structure predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. Additionally, note that ESM log-likelihood ratios are generally in the range of 5-10 (higher is better), AlphaFold-Multimer interface pLDDT confidence scores are generally in the range of 60-80 (higher is better), and Rosetta binding energy scores are generally in the range of -20 to -40 (lower is better).

As a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:

1. In each iteration, what is the order of operations for evaluating mutations with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?

2. In each iteration, how many mutations (give a single number) will you evaluate with ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta?

3. At the end of each iteration, how will you weigh the ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and/or Rosetta scores (give a formula) to rank the nanobody mutations?

4. At the end of each iteration, how many of the top-ranked mutations (give a single number) will you keep for the next round?

5. How will you decide how many iterations of mutations to run?

6. After all of the iterations are complete, how exactly (step-by-step) will you select the final set of 24 modified nanobodies from across the iterations for experimental validation?



Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

- **Iterations**: 3-4 iterations are suggested in summaries 2, 4, and 5, balancing exploration and resource constraints.
- **Final Selection**: Steps for selecting the final set are synthesized from summaries 3, 4, and 5, focusing on diversity and expert validation.

This plan optimizes the use of computational tools within the given constraints, aiming to identify promising nanobody candidates efficiently.
