This provides a direct link to resources necessary for real ESM data integration.\n\n2. **User Documentation and Example**:\n   - Improved input validation with specific error messages. This ensures users receive immediate feedback on input errors.\n   - Present an explicit example usage comment: `# Example: python script.py \"MKTAYIAKQRQISFVD\" --top-n 5` to illustrate how users should run the script.\n\n3. **Scientific Context and Validation**:\n   - Enhanced output section with explanations of what high or low log-likelihood ratios might imply, providing users with a better understanding of their significance.\n   - Suggested further exploration through docking studies or assays with a brief mention of their importance.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Scalability**:\n   - While specific optimization strategies are not detailed, the code comments allude to potential limitations and the need for computational resources when scaling up.\n\nThese improvements ensure the script is not only a useful tool for computational predictions but also a gateway for users to engage with real-world data and further scientific exploration, making it more aligned with the agenda and user needs.\n\n[end summary 5]\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nPlease read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.\n\nAs a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Now you must use ESM to suggest modifications to an existing antibody. Please write a complete Python script that takes a nanobody sequence as input and uses ESM amino acid log-likelihoods to identify the most promising point mutations by log-likelihood ratio.\n\nAs a reference, here are the agenda rules from those meetings, which must be followed here as well:\n\n1. Your code must be self-contained (with appropriate imports) and complete.\n\n2. Your code may not include any undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.\n\n3. Your code may not include any pseudocode; it must be fully functioning code.\n\n4. Your code may not include any hard-coded examples.\n\n5. If your code needs user-provided values, write code to parse those values from the command line.\n\n6. Your code must be high quality, well-engineered, efficient, and well-documented (including docstrings, comments, and Python type hints if using Python).\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

This enhances usability and prevents runtime errors.\n\n3. **Log-Likelihood Computation** (from Summary 4 and 5):\n   - The script computes log-likelihood ratios for mutations, focusing on amino acids relevant to the task. This aligns with the agenda's goal of identifying promising mutations.\n\n4. **Error Handling and User Guidance** (from Summary 4):\n   - The script includes error handling for model loading and computation, with clear messages guiding users on setup and troubleshooting. This ensures robustness and user-friendliness.\n\n5. **Biological Interpretation** (from Summary 4 and 5):\n   - The script provides guidance on interpreting results, emphasizing the need for experimental validation and considering biological context. This aligns with the scientific goals of the project.\n\nThese components were selected to create a comprehensive, user-friendly, and scientifically relevant script that meets the agenda's requirements for developing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants."
