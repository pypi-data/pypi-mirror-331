Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Now you must use ESM to suggest modifications to an existing antibody. Please write a complete Python script that takes a nanobody sequence as input and uses ESM amino acid log-likelihoods to identify the most promising point mutations by log-likelihood ratio.\n\nHere are the agenda rules that must be followed:\n\n1. Your code must be self-contained (with appropriate imports) and complete.\n\n2. Your code may not include any undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.\n\n3. Your code may not include any pseudocode; it must be fully functioning code.\n\n4. Your code may not include any hard-coded examples.\n\n5. If your code needs user-provided values, write code to parse those values from the command line.\n\n6. Your code must be high quality, well-engineered, efficient, and well-documented (including docstrings, comments, and Python type hints if using Python).\n\nMachine Learning Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "The script provided by the Machine Learning Specialist includes several strengths and some areas for improvement:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Self-contained and Complete**: The script complies with the agenda by being self-contained, including necessary imports, and providing a complete implementation without undefined or unimplemented variables or pseudocode.\n2. **Command-line Parsing**: It employs `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments, adhering to the requirement that the code should not include hard-coded examples and must allow user-provided values.\n3. **Documentation**: The script is well-documented with comments and docstrings, enhancing readability and understanding.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **ESM Integration**: The current implementation uses a mock function (`compute_log_likelihoods`) to generate random log-likelihoods. The agenda requires using ESM to suggest modifications. The script should provide more detailed guidance on how to integrate actual ESM predictions, such as specifying any libraries or APIs needed.\n   \n2. **Validation and Error Handling**: The script lacks validation for the input sequence. It should include checks to ensure the sequence only contains valid amino acid characters and handle potential errors (e.g., empty input, invalid characters) gracefully.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Performance**: While the script is relatively simple, it could benefit from a brief discussion on performance considerations, especially when interfacing with a potentially complex model like ESM. Suggesting strategies for handling large sequences efficiently would improve robustness.\n\n4. **Output Detail**: The output currently lists mutations with improved log-likelihoods, but it does not quantify the improvement or provide context. Including log-likelihood ratio values or ranking mutations by their potential impact might make the output more useful for decision-making.\n\n5. **Scientific Rigor**: The script assumes that any increase in log-likelihood is beneficial, which may not always be the case scientifically. It would be beneficial to discuss criteria for selecting mutations beyond simple likelihood improvements, such as structural considerations or empirical validation steps.\n\n### Corrective Feedback:\n- **Integrate Real ESM Data**: Provide instructions or references for integrating actual ESM data instead of placeholders.\n- **Input Validation**: Add input validation to ensure robustness against invalid sequences.\n- **Enrich Output**: Enhance the output by including quantitative measures of improvement and potentially a ranking system for the suggested mutations.\n- **Scientific Justification**: Include a brief discussion on the biological relevance and validation of selected mutations, where applicable.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the script would not only meet the agenda requirements more thoroughly but also provide a more scientifically grounded and practical tool for its intended purpose."
