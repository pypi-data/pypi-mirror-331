This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Machine Learning Specialist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic "ESM" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on ESM to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on ESM. Include both queries about ESM generally as well as queries about how ESM relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on ESM (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Machine Learning Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Machine Learning Specialist

To identify the relevant literature on ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) and its application in designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2, I would perform the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both the general understanding of ESM and its specific application in the context of SARS-CoV-2 nanobody design:

```python
queries = [
    "Evolutionary Scale Modeling in protein design",
    "ESM for antibody and nanobody optimization",
    "ESM SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding",
    "Machine learning ESM nanobody design SARS-CoV-2",
    "ESM applications in viral protein interactions"
]
```

These queries aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of how ESM can be leveraged to enhance the design and optimization of nanobodies, particularly against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its variants.
