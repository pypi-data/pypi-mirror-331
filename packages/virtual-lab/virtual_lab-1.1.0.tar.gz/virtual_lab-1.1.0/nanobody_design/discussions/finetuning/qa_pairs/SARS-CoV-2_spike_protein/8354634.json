        "What is a significant advantage of Nanosota-1C-Fc over ACE2 as mentioned in the summary?": [
            "It has a binding affinity to the RBD approximately 3000 times stronger than ACE2.",
            "It can be administered orally without degradation.",
            "It is less expensive to produce than ACE2.",
            "It does not require refrigeration for storage."
        ],
        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described in the summary?": [
            "Facilitating viral entry into host cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "Providing structural stability to the virus particle.",
            "Acting as a decoy to evade the host immune system.",
            "Replicating the viral RNA within host cells."
        ],
        "What potential application of Nanosota-1C is suggested in the summary beyond systemic administration?": [
            "As an inhaler or oral drug to treat respiratory or intestinal infections.",
            "As a topical cream for skin infections.",
            "As a vaccine adjuvant to boost immune response.",
            "As a dietary supplement to enhance immunity."
        ],
        "What structural insight about Nanosota-1C is highlighted in the summary?": [
            "It binds near the center of the RBM, overlapping with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "It binds exclusively to the open conformation of the spike protein.",
            "It interacts with the N-terminal domain of the spike protein.",
            "It forms a covalent bond with the RBD, preventing dissociation."
