            "They compensate for reduced binding to certain RBD variants, including mutations like E484K and N501Y.",
            "They can bind to the viral RNA, preventing mutations from affecting their efficacy.",

            "The length of the linker, as longer linkers may allow binding to adjacent RBDs on the same spike trimer.",
            "The charge of the linker, which should be positive to enhance binding affinity.",
            "The hydrophobicity of the linker, which should be minimized to prevent aggregation.",

        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 and why?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, due to its critical role in viral entry and accessibility on the viral surface.",
            "The nucleocapsid protein, because it is highly conserved and abundant in the virus.",
            "The membrane protein, as it is involved in viral assembly and release.",
            "The envelope protein, due to its role in viral budding and pathogenesis."
