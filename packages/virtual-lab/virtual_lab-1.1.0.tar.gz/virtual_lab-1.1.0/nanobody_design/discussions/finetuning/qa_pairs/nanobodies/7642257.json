        "How do nanobodies stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to prevent viral entry into host cells?": [
            "They stabilize the spike protein in a conformation that prevents viral fusion and entry.",
            "They degrade the spike protein, rendering the virus non-infectious.",
            "They bind to the viral RNA, preventing replication.",
            "They enhance the spike protein's affinity for the ACE2 receptor, blocking other viruses."
        ],
        "What display technologies are mentioned as methods for selecting nanobodies against viral epitopes?": [
            "Bacterial, yeast, or ribosomal display.",
            "Phage, mammalian, or insect cell display.",
            "Viral, plant, or algae display.",
            "Cell-free, amphibian, or reptilian display."
        ],
        "What is a challenge mentioned regarding the clinical utility of nanobodies in COVID-19 treatment?": [
            "Their clinical utility needs further validation through rigorous clinical trials.",
            "Their production is limited to specific geographic regions.",
            "They have a high risk of causing allergic reactions in patients.",
            "Their stability is compromised at room temperature."
        ],
        "What is a potential therapeutic application of nanobodies beyond neutralizing the virus?": [
            "They can be engineered to deliver viral antigens to antigen-presenting cells to enhance the anti-viral CD8+ T cell response.",
            "They can be used to directly lyse infected host cells.",
            "They can inhibit the replication of viral RNA within host cells.",
            "They can enhance the production of host cell cytokines to boost immune response."
        ],
        "What is one advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization?": [
            "Nanobodies lack the Fc region, minimizing the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).",
            "Nanobodies have a larger size, allowing them to cover more viral surface area.",
            "Nanobodies can only be produced in mammalian cell systems, ensuring higher fidelity.",
            "Nanobodies require complex purification processes, increasing their specificity."
