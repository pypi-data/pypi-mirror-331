        "How do Class III nanobodies neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the study?": [
            "They induce an all-RBD-up conformation, potentially leading to premature spike cleavage.",
            "They directly compete with ACE2 for binding to the spike protein.",
            "They bind to conserved epitopes, maintaining activity against VOCs.",
            "They block the virus's ability to bind to the host receptor by targeting the ACE2-binding site."

        "What advantage do nanobodies have over conventional monoclonal antibodies in targeting SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "Nanobodies have a lower probability of targeting variant-prone regions, making them less susceptible to escape mutations.",
            "Nanobodies are larger, allowing them to cover more surface area on the virus.",
            "Nanobodies can only target the ACE2-binding site, ensuring direct competition with the virus.",
            "Nanobodies are more likely to target variant-prone regions, increasing their adaptability."

        "What are the three classes of neutralizing epitopes identified in the study for nanobodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Class I targets the ACE2-binding site, Class II binds to conserved epitopes, and Class III recognizes unique epitopes.",
            "Class I targets conserved epitopes, Class II binds to the ACE2-binding site, and Class III recognizes unique epitopes.",
            "Class I targets unique epitopes, Class II binds to conserved epitopes, and Class III recognizes the ACE2-binding site.",
            "Class I targets the ACE2-binding site, Class II recognizes unique epitopes, and Class III binds to conserved epitopes."

        "What potential therapeutic application is suggested for nanobodies due to their stability and production characteristics?": [
            "Inhalation therapies due to their stability and ease of production.",
            "Intravenous therapies due to their large size and complexity.",
            "Oral therapies due to their ability to withstand digestive enzymes.",
            "Topical therapies due to their ability to penetrate the skin."
