        "What is the significance of targeting conserved epitopes in the spike protein for nanobody design?": [
            "Conserved epitopes are less prone to mutations, enhancing the breadth and potency of neutralization",
            "Conserved epitopes are more accessible, making them easier to target",
            "Conserved epitopes are unique to each variant, allowing for specific targeting",
            "Conserved epitopes are located on the virus surface, facilitating easier binding"

        "What structural technique was used to analyze the neutralization mechanisms of bnAbs in the study?": [
            "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)",
            "X-ray crystallography",
            "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy",

            "A five-dose regimen including both mRNA and inactivated whole-virion vaccines",
            "A three-dose regimen of only mRNA vaccines",
            "A four-dose regimen of only inactivated whole-virion vaccines",

        "What was the outcome of using bnAbs in animal models according to the study?": [
            "Significant reduction in viral replication and infection in the nasal turbinate and lungs",
            "Complete eradication of the virus from the bloodstream",
            "Increased immune response leading to faster recovery",
            "No significant change in viral load compared to controls"
