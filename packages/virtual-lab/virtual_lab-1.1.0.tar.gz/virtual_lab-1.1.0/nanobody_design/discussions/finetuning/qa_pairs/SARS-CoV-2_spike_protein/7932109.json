        "What advantage do biparatopic nanobodies like VHH VE have over single nanobodies in preventing mutational escape?": [
            "They target two independent epitopes, largely preventing the emergence of resistant escape mutants.",
            "They bind more strongly to a single epitope, reducing the chance of escape mutations.",
            "They induce a stronger immune response, eliminating the virus before mutations can occur.",
            "They block the spike protein from folding correctly, preventing any mutations from being expressed."
        ],
        "What are the two major configurations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mentioned in the study?": [
            "\"Down\" conformation and \"up\" conformation",
            "\"Closed\" conformation and \"open\" conformation",
            "\"Inactive\" conformation and \"active\" conformation",
            "\"Folded\" conformation and \"unfolded\" conformation"
        ],
        "What is a key clinical implication of the study regarding the use of nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Nanobodies could be developed for passive immunization due to their ease of production and stability.",
            "Nanobodies are likely to replace vaccines as the primary method of COVID-19 prevention.",
            "Nanobodies will be used exclusively for treating severe cases of COVID-19 in hospitals.",
            "Nanobodies are expected to be ineffective against future variants of SARS-CoV-2."
        ],
        "What is the role of VHH E nanobody in the mechanism of spike protein neutralization?": [
            "It binds to the ACE2 binding site on the RBD, stabilizing the spike in the \"3-up\" conformation.",
            "It prevents the spike protein from binding to ACE2 by blocking the \"down\" conformation.",
            "It destabilizes the spike protein, causing it to revert to the \"down\" conformation.",
            "It binds to the N-terminal domain, preventing the spike from transitioning to the \"up\" conformation."

        "Which animal sources were used to identify nanobodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
