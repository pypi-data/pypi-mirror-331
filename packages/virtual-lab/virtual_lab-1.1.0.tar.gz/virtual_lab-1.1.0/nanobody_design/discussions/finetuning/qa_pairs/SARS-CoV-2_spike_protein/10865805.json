        "How does the study propose to achieve broad-spectrum efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "By designing spike proteins that elicit cross-reactive antibodies.",
            "By using a combination of different viral vectors.",
            "By targeting only the Omicron variant specifically.",
            "By focusing on the nucleocapsid protein instead of the spike protein."

            "It has a proven safety record and potential for long-lasting immune responses.",
            "It allows for rapid mutation to match emerging variants.",
            "It is easier to produce than other viral vectors.",
            "It targets a different part of the immune system than other vaccines."

        "What is the primary purpose of using prefusion stabilization in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for vaccine development?": [
            "To maintain the native conformation necessary for eliciting a robust immune response.",
            "To increase the spike protein's ability to mutate and evade immune detection.",
            "To enhance the spike protein's ability to bind to host cell receptors.",
            "To reduce the overall size of the spike protein for easier incorporation into vaccines."
