        "What is a key feature of the peptide epitope used for nanobody screening that enhances its suitability as a target?": [
            "It is devoid of glycosylation sites, which can interfere with antibody binding",
            "It contains multiple disulfide bonds for structural stability",
            "It is highly glycosylated to enhance binding affinity",
            "It includes a polyhistidine tag for easy purification"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the nanobodies developed in the study for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry?": [
            "The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein",

        "What was the main advantage of the bivalent version of the nanobody N1.2, termed (N1.2)2?": [
            "It showed a cooperative effect, significantly reducing pseudoviral transduction even at lower concentrations",
            "It was easier to produce in bacterial systems",
            "It had a longer serum half-life than the monovalent form",
            "It was more resistant to thermal degradation"
