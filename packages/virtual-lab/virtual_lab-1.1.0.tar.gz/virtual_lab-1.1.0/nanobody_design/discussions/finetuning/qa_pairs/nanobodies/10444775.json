        "How many nanobodies were identified in the study that showed binding to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins?": [
            "23 nanobodies",

            "30 nanobodies",

        "What is the primary advantage of using nanobodies derived from llamas to target SARS-like coronaviruses?": [
            "Their smaller size allows them to access conserved epitopes on the spike protein that might be inaccessible to larger antibodies.",
            "They can be produced in larger quantities than conventional antibodies.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream compared to conventional antibodies.",
            "They are less expensive to produce than conventional antibodies."

        "What structural techniques were used to map the binding epitopes and understand the interaction mechanisms of the nanobodies with the spike protein?": [
            "X-ray crystallography and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)",
            "Cryo-electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy",

        ],
        "What was the purpose of employing a heterologous immunization strategy in llamas in the study?": [
            "To stimulate the production of cross-reactive nanobodies using spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS-CoV.",
            "To increase the overall yield of nanobodies produced by the llamas.",
            "To ensure that the nanobodies produced were specific to SARS-CoV-2 only.",
            "To test the effectiveness of different adjuvants in llama immunization."

        "Which unique feature does the nanobody 7A9 possess according to the study?": [
            "It targets a novel, highly conserved epitope on the RBD, which is partially occluded by the N-terminal domain (NTD) and remains effective against the Omicron variant.",
            "It binds exclusively to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein.",
            "It is the only nanobody that does not require multimerization to enhance potency.",
            "It targets a non-conserved epitope that is unique to SARS-CoV-2."
