        "How do the bispecific and multivalent constructs of sybodies help in preventing viral escape?": [
            "By targeting multiple epitopes simultaneously.",
            "By increasing the mutation rate of the virus.",
            "By binding to the viral RNA directly.",
            "By blocking the virus's replication machinery."

        "What advantage do sybodies have over conventional antibodies according to the study?": [
            "They offer rapid development, low-cost production, and easy engineering.",
            "They have a higher affinity for the host cell receptors.",
            "They can integrate into the host genome for long-term immunity.",
            "They are capable of self-replication within the host."

        "What is the primary role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein as described in the study?": [
            "It is crucial for the virus's ability to recognize and fuse with host cell membranes.",
            "It is responsible for the virus's replication within host cells.",
            "It acts as a decoy to evade the host's immune system.",
            "It primarily functions in the degradation of host cellular proteins."

        "Which two key antibody recognition hotspots are found in the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "One overlapping with the ACE2 binding site and a conserved 'cryptic' epitope.",
            "Two distinct sites both overlapping with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "One at the N-terminal domain and another at the S2 subunit.",
