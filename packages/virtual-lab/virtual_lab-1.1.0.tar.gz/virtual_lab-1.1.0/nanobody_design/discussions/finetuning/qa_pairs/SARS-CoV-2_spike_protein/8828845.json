        "How did deep-mutational scanning contribute to the study's findings on Nb1\u2013Nb2?": [
            "It revealed that Nb1\u2013Nb2 is resistant to escape by over 60 RBD mutations",
            "It showed that Nb1\u2013Nb2 is susceptible to mutations in the nucleocapsid protein",
            "It indicated that Nb1\u2013Nb2 has a limited neutralization range against SARS-CoV-2 variants",
            "It demonstrated that Nb1\u2013Nb2 is ineffective against the Omicron variant"
        ],
        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2, as discussed in the paper?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein",
            "The membrane protein",
            "The envelope protein"
        ],
        "What is the significance of the biparatopic design of the nanobody Nb1\u2013Nb2?": [
            "It targets overlapping but distinct RBD epitopes, reducing the risk of viral escape",
            "It increases the size of the nanobody, making it easier to produce",
            "It allows the nanobody to bind to the nucleocapsid protein as well",
            "It enhances the nanobody's ability to penetrate host cells"
        ],
        "What was the purpose of constructing a tetravalent heavy-chain antibody (Nb1\u2013Nb2-Fc)?": [
            "To improve pharmacokinetics and therapeutic potential",
            "To increase the size of the antibody for easier detection",
            "To allow the antibody to bind to multiple viruses simultaneously",
            "To enhance the antibody's ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier"
        ],
        "Which variants of SARS-CoV-2 did the biparatopic nanobody Nb1\u2013Nb2 demonstrate strong neutralization against?": [
