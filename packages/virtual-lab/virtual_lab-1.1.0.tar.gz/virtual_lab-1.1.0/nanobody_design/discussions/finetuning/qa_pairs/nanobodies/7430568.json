        "What enhancement was achieved by creating a trivalent form of the nanobody mNb6?": [
            "The trivalent form significantly enhanced binding affinity and neutralization potency.",
            "The trivalent form reduced the molecular weight, improving delivery efficiency.",
            "The trivalent form increased the nanobody's half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "The trivalent form allowed for selective binding to mutated Spike proteins."

            "Nb6 locks the RBDs of the Spike protein in the down-state, preventing ACE2 binding.",
            "Nb6 binds to the ACE2 receptor, blocking the Spike protein from attaching.",
            "Nb6 degrades the Spike protein, preventing it from binding to ACE2.",
            "Nb6 binds to the Spike protein's S2 subunit, inhibiting membrane fusion."

        "What is the primary advantage of nanobodies over traditional monoclonal antibodies in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein?": [
            "Nanobodies are smaller and can access epitopes inaccessible to larger antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies have a higher molecular weight, allowing for better stability.",
            "Nanobodies can only bind to the ACE2 receptor, making them more specific.",
            "Nanobodies are derived from human antibodies, reducing immunogenicity."

        "What structural technique was used to determine how nanobodies bind to the Spike protein?": [
            "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was used.",
