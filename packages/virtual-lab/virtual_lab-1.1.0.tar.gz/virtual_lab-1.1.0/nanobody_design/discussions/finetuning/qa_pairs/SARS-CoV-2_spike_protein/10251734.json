        "How does W25 enhance its neutralization potency according to the study?": [
            "Through Fc fusion, allowing dimerization and simultaneous engagement of two RBDs",
            "By increasing its binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor",
            "Through glycosylation modifications that enhance binding",
            "By targeting multiple epitopes on the spike protein simultaneously"
        ],
        "What delivery method was found to be particularly effective for W25-Fc against Omicron in mouse models?": [
            "Intranasal delivery",

        "What is a significant advantage of W25 in terms of production and stability?": [
            "It exhibits high thermostability and can be produced in prokaryotic systems",
            "It requires complex eukaryotic systems for production",
            "It is unstable at room temperature and requires cold storage",
            "It can only be produced in mammalian cell lines"

        "What is the primary target of the nanobody W25 developed in the study?": [
            "A unique, conserved epitope on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "A variable region on the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"
        ],
        "What mechanism does W25 use to potentially prevent viral entry?": [
            "Partially overlapping with the ACE2 binding site on the RBD",
