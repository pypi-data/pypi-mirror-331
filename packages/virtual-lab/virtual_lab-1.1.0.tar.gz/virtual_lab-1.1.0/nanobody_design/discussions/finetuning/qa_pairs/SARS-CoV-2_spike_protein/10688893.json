        "What challenge does the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants pose for antibody-based therapeutics?": [
            "Variants with mutations in the S-RBD can lead to immune escape and reduced efficacy of existing antibodies",
            "Variants are less likely to mutate in the S-RBD region",
            "Variants do not affect the binding affinity of antibodies",
            "Variants enhance the efficacy of existing antibodies"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the bispecific nanobodies developed in the study?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2"
        ],
        "What is the role of Nb-015 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "It competes with ACE2 binding by targeting a conserved epitope on the ridge of the S-RBD external subdomain",
            "It binds to a cryptic conserved epitope on the core subdomain of S-RBD",
            "It destabilizes the pre-fusion conformation of the spike protein",
            "It enhances the immune response by binding to the nucleocapsid protein"
        ],
        "What is the significance of the bispecific nanobody conjugate Nb-X2-Fc?": [
            "It enhances the breadth and potency of neutralization across various SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sub-lineages",
            "It specifically targets only the original SARS-CoV-2 strain",
            "It is designed to bind exclusively to the Delta variant",
            "It shows reduced efficacy against all known SARS-CoV-2 variants"

        "Which two nanobodies were identified from an immunized alpaca in the study?": [
