        "How does NB1A7 interact with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "It forms a \u03b2-strand interaction with the RBD using the CDR3 loop",
            "It binds through shape complementarity without disrupting the RBD conformation",
            "It engages the RBD using the CDR1 and CDR3 loops",
            "It targets the N-terminal domain of the spike protein"

            "They demonstrated binding affinity in the femtomole range",
            "They showed reduced binding affinity compared to monomeric forms",
            "They were unable to bind the 'up' conformation of the RBD",

        "What is the primary target of the nanobody NB1B11 in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The ACE2-binding site on the RBD",
            "A cryptic epitope distant from the ACE2 binding site",
