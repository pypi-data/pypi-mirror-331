        "What are the key advantages of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 treatment?": [
            "Nanobodies are smaller and more stable, allowing them to access less accessible epitopes and be produced cost-effectively in microbial systems.",
            "Nanobodies have a higher molecular weight, which increases their binding strength to the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies can only be produced in mammalian systems, making them more specific to human pathogens.",
            "Nanobodies are larger and more complex, which enhances their ability to neutralize multiple viral proteins simultaneously."

        "Why is the ability of nanobodies to bind conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein significant?": [
            "It offers the potential for broad neutralization across different variants, including the Omicron variant.",
            "It allows nanobodies to be more easily engineered to bind to non-conserved regions.",
            "It reduces the need for combination therapies with other therapeutic agents.",
            "It ensures that nanobodies can only neutralize the original strain of SARS-CoV-2."
