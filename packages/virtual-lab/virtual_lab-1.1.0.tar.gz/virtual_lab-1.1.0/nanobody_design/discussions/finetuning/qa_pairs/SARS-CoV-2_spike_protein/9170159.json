        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) crucial for binding to the hACE2 receptor.",
            "It facilitates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.",
            "It anchors the spike protein to the viral membrane.",
            "It is responsible for the trimerization of the spike protein."

            "As inhaled drugs for treating respiratory diseases.",
