        "How do nanobody cocktails enhance neutralization efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "By combining nanobodies that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes, creating synergistic effects",
            "By targeting only the receptor-binding domain to increase specificity",
            "By increasing the size of the nanobodies to cover more surface area",
            "By focusing solely on the S2 domain to prevent membrane fusion"
        ],
        "What challenge does the antigenic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pose to antibody design?": [
            "Mutations in the spike protein, particularly in the RBD, reduce the efficacy of many monoclonal antibodies",
            "The spike protein's high glycosylation prevents antibody binding",
            "The spike protein's trimeric structure makes it inaccessible to antibodies",
            "The N-terminal domain's undefined function complicates antibody targeting"
        ],
        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the S1 subunit",
            "The N-terminal domain (NTD)",
            "The S2 domain",
            "The glycosylation sites on the spike protein"
        ],
        "What potential applications do nanobodies have beyond therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They can be used in diagnostic applications to identify circulating strains",
            "They can be used to enhance vaccine efficacy by acting as adjuvants",
            "They can be employed to directly inhibit viral replication machinery",
            "They can be used to modify host cell receptors to prevent viral entry"
        ],
        "Why are nanobodies considered advantageous over conventional monoclonal antibodies in targeting SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They are smaller and more stable, allowing access to epitopes inaccessible to larger antibodies",
            "They have higher glycosylation, which enhances binding affinity",
            "They can only bind to the N-terminal domain, reducing off-target effects",
            "They are derived from human antibodies, increasing compatibility"
