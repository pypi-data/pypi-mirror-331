            "By predicting evolutionary dynamics and guiding sequence design for high binding affinity and stability.",
            "By providing a database of pre-designed nanobody sequences.",

            "It often results in sequences that are less native-like compared to natural proteins.",

            "Structure-based methods focus on specific conformational states, while sequence-based methods provide a broader evolutionary context.",
            "Sequence-based methods are always superior to structure-based methods in protein design.",

            "To guide the design process towards sequences that are more likely to be stable and functional.",
            "To increase the computational speed of protein design processes.",
            "To eliminate the need for experimental validation of designed proteins.",

        "What was the outcome of integrating ESM predictions with Rosetta in terms of PLM scores?": [
            "Designed sequences had better PLM scores, indicating a closer resemblance to native sequences.",
