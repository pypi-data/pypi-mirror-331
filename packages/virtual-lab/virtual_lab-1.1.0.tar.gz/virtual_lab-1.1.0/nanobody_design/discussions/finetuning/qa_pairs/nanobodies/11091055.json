        "How was the nanobody N235 identified according to the study?": [
            "It was identified from a library of nanobodies generated using phage-display technology after immunizing alpacas with SARS-CoV-2 spike and NTD proteins.",
            "It was discovered through a high-throughput screening of human antibody libraries.",
            "It was isolated from convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients.",
            "It was synthesized de novo using computational protein design techniques."
        ],
        "What evidence supports the potential therapeutic application of MN235 for respiratory administration?": [
            "MN235 demonstrated effective prophylactic protection against Omicron sub-variants BA.1 and XBB in a mouse model when administered intranasally.",
            "MN235 showed increased binding affinity to human lung tissue in vitro.",
            "MN235 was found to be stable in aerosol form for inhalation therapy.",
            "MN235 exhibited rapid clearance from the bloodstream, reducing systemic side effects."
        ],
        "What is the main advantage of targeting conserved epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, as highlighted in the study?": [
            "They are less susceptible to mutations compared to receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes.",
            "They are more accessible for antibody binding than RBD epitopes.",
            "They enhance the binding affinity of antibodies to the spike protein.",
            "They allow for easier engineering of antibodies due to their structural simplicity."
        ],
        "What structural feature of MN235 contributes to its enhanced neutralization potency compared to N235?": [
            "Its decameric IgM-like structure, which allows for cross-linking virus particles.",
            "Its monomeric IgG-like structure, which increases binding specificity.",
            "Its dimeric IgA-like structure, which enhances mucosal immunity.",
            "Its tetrameric IgE-like structure, which boosts allergic responses."
        ],
        "What unique mechanism of action does N235 employ to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, as described in the study?": [
            "It binds to a cryptic epitope in the NTD, interfering with the neighboring RBD and inducing S1 subunit shedding from the spike protein complex.",
            "It directly blocks the ACE2 receptor binding site on the RBD.",
            "It aggregates viral particles, preventing them from entering host cells.",
            "It enhances the immune response by recruiting immune cells to the site of infection."
