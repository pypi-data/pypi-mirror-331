            "The K417V mutation results in more spike proteins in the open conformation, facilitating better ACE2 binding.",
            "The K417V mutation stabilizes the closed conformation, reducing ACE2 binding.",
            "The K417V mutation prevents the spike protein from binding to ACE2 altogether.",
            "The K417V mutation causes the spike protein to misfold, reducing its infectivity."

        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Nanobodies can bind to cryptic epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies have a higher binding affinity to the spike protein than conventional antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies can neutralize the virus without binding to the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies are less susceptible to mutations in the spike protein than conventional antibodies."

        "What is the significance of the conformational flexibility of the spike protein in immune evasion?": [
            "The spike's ability to switch between open and closed conformations helps hide key neutralizing epitopes.",
            "The spike's conformational flexibility allows it to bind to multiple receptors on host cells.",
            "The spike's flexibility enables it to evade detection by the host's innate immune system.",
            "The spike's conformational changes increase its resistance to antiviral drugs."

        "What role does Lys417 play in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein according to the study?": [
            "Lys417 acts as a molecular switch that stabilizes the closed conformation by forming a hydrogen bond with another spike subunit.",
            "Lys417 enhances the open conformation by disrupting hydrogen bonds with the spike subunit.",
            "Lys417 directly binds to ACE2, increasing viral entry efficiency.",
            "Lys417 is responsible for the spike protein's dimerization, affecting its stability."
        ],
        "Why is targeting epitopes accessible in both open and closed conformations beneficial for nanobody design?": [
            "It allows nanobodies to bind effectively regardless of the spike's conformational state, increasing their neutralizing potential.",
            "It ensures nanobodies can only bind when the spike protein is in the open conformation, enhancing specificity.",
            "It prevents nanobodies from binding to the spike protein, reducing off-target effects.",
            "It makes nanobodies more resistant to degradation by host enzymes."
