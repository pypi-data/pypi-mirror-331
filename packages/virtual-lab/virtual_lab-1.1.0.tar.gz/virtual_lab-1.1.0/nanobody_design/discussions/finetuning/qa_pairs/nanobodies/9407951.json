        "How does the SP1-77 antibody inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells?": [
            "By blocking the dissociation of the S1 subunit from the pre-cleaved S1/S2 complex, inhibiting membrane fusion.",
            "By preventing the virus from binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells.",
            "By disrupting the viral envelope, leading to viral lysis.",
            "By inhibiting the viral RNA polymerase, stopping viral replication."

        "What is the primary advantage of using a humanized mouse model in the study of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies?": [
            "It generates human-like antibodies with a diverse BCR repertoire through V(D)J recombination.",
            "It allows for direct testing of antibodies in human subjects without ethical concerns.",
            "It produces antibodies that are inherently resistant to viral mutations.",
            "It simplifies the process of antibody purification and production."

        "What is the unique feature of the SP1-77 antibody's binding mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "SP1-77 binds to a distinct epitope on the RBD, away from the RBM, and inhibits viral-host membrane fusion.",
            "SP1-77 binds directly to the ACE2 receptor, preventing viral attachment.",
            "SP1-77 targets the viral nucleocapsid protein, disrupting viral replication.",
            "SP1-77 neutralizes the virus by binding to the viral RNA genome."

        "What potential advantage do nanobodies have according to the study's findings on SP1-77?": [
            "Nanobodies can access cryptic epitopes and exploit CDR3-dominated recognition modes.",
            "Nanobodies can directly block the ACE2 receptor with higher affinity than traditional antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies are more stable at room temperature, making them easier to store and transport.",
            "Nanobodies can be produced more rapidly than traditional antibodies in bacterial systems."
        ],
        "What therapeutic potential does the SP1-77 antibody have according to the study?": [
            "SP1-77's broad neutralization profile makes it a promising candidate for combination therapies with other antibodies.",
            "SP1-77 can be used as a standalone treatment for all viral infections due to its unique mechanism.",
            "SP1-77 is primarily useful for diagnostic purposes rather than therapeutic applications.",
            "SP1-77 is only effective when used in conjunction with antiviral drugs."
