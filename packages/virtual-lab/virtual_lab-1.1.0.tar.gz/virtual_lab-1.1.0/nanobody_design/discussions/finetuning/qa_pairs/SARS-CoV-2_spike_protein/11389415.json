            "It is crucial for successful membrane fusion and viral entry.",
            "It prevents premature fusion and allows the spike to revert to a prefusion state.",
            "It stabilizes the spike protein in its prefusion conformation.",
            "It inhibits the fusion process by blocking the PS-binding site."

            "Phosphatidylserine (PS)",
            "Phosphatidylcholine (PC)",
            "Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)",

            "The PS-dependent fusion mechanism is conserved across various variants.",
            "The PS-dependent fusion mechanism is unique to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.",
            "The PS-dependent fusion mechanism varies significantly between different variants.",
