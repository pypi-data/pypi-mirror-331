        "How do shark-derived VNAR antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They block the ACE2-RBD interaction and neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2, including variants with mutations like E484K and N501Y.",
            "They enhance the ACE2-RBD interaction, preventing the virus from binding to host cells.",
            "They bind to the spike protein's S2 subunit, inhibiting viral fusion with host cells.",
            "They target the nucleocapsid protein, disrupting viral replication within host cells."
        ],
        "What are the structural and functional advantages of nanobodies that make them suitable for targeting viral proteins like the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Nanobodies are small, stable, and can be engineered for high antigen-binding affinity, allowing efficient tissue penetration and targeting of non-planar surfaces.",
            "Nanobodies are large, unstable, and have low antigen-binding affinity, making them unsuitable for targeting non-planar surfaces.",
            "Nanobodies are medium-sized, moderately stable, and have average antigen-binding affinity, which limits their ability to penetrate tissues.",
            "Nanobodies are small, unstable, and cannot be engineered for high antigen-binding affinity, restricting their use in targeting viral proteins."
        ],
        "What challenge does the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate pose for nanobody development?": [
            "The virus can evade neutralization, but the modularity and ease of engineering nanobodies allow for rapid adaptation to emerging variants.",
            "The virus can become more susceptible to neutralization, reducing the need for further nanobody development.",
            "The virus can lose its spike protein, making nanobody targeting ineffective.",
            "The virus can integrate into host DNA, making nanobody targeting irrelevant."
