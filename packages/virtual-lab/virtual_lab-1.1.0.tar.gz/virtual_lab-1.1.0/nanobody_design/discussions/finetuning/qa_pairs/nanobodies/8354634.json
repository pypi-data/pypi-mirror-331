        "How was the Nanosota-1 series identified for targeting SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "It was identified from a camelid nanobody phage display library screened against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain.",
            "It was identified through computational modeling of potential nanobody structures.",
            "It was identified by screening human convalescent plasma for effective antibodies.",
            "It was identified through random mutagenesis of existing therapeutic antibodies."
        ],
        "In which animal models was Nanosota-1C-Fc tested for in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Hamster and human ACE2-transgenic mouse models.",
            "Rabbit and ferret models.",
            "Non-human primate and guinea pig models.",
            "Rat and chicken models."
        ],
        "What is the origin of the nanobodies used in the Nanosota-1 series?": [
            "They are derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids such as llamas and alpacas.",
            "They are derived from conventional antibodies found in humans.",
            "They are synthesized entirely through chemical processes without biological origin.",
            "They are derived from antibodies found in rodents such as mice and rats."
        ],
        "What modification was made to Nanosota-1C to enhance its pharmacokinetic properties?": [
            "An Fc tag was added to create a bivalent construct with increased molecular weight.",
            "A polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain was attached to increase solubility.",
            "A lipid tail was added to improve membrane association.",
            "A fluorescent marker was attached for better tracking in vivo."
        ],
        "What structural feature of Nanosota-1C allows it to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to host cells?": [
            "It binds near the center of the receptor-binding motif, overlapping with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "It binds to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, preventing conformational changes.",
            "It attaches to the viral envelope, disrupting membrane fusion.",
            "It binds to the nucleocapsid protein, inhibiting viral replication."
