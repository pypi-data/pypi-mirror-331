        "What is one of the challenges in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "The rapid mutation rate of the spike protein, particularly in the RBD.",
            "The inability of antibodies to bind to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "The lack of structural data on the spike protein.",
            "The high stability of the spike protein, making it difficult to target."
        ],
        "What is the mechanism by which C5G2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "It binds to the RBD, interacts with the NTD, and causes steric hindrance that prevents ACE2 from binding.",
            "It directly blocks the ACE2 receptor on host cells.",
            "It degrades the spike protein, preventing viral entry.",
            "It binds to the S2 subunit, inhibiting membrane fusion."
        ],
        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD)",
            "The N-terminal domain (NTD)",
            "The S2 subunit",
            "The ACE2 receptor"
        ],
        "What unique feature allows the synthetic nanobody C5G2 to maintain efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "It binds to a conserved region of the RBD that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "It binds directly to the ACE2 receptor, preventing viral entry.",
            "It targets only the NTD, avoiding the rapidly mutating RBD.",
            "It inhibits the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane."
        ],
        "Why does C5G2 show reduced activity against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Due to the L452R mutation in the spike protein.",
            "Because it cannot bind to the NTD of the Delta variant.",
            "Because the Delta variant lacks the conserved region targeted by C5G2.",
            "Due to a mutation in the ACE2 receptor that affects binding."
