        "How does DH1047's binding footprint compare to other known antibodies like ADG-2 and CR3022?": [
            "It overlaps but has a unique angle of approach and binding characteristics",
            "It is identical to the binding footprint of ADG-2",
            "It does not overlap with any known antibodies",
            "It is completely different from CR3022's binding footprint"
        ],
        "What is a key feature of the epitope targeted by DH1047 that makes it a promising target for broad-spectrum therapeutics?": [
            "It is highly conserved among various sarbecoviruses",
            "It is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus",
            "It is located in the viral RNA genome",
            "It is a variable region prone to mutations"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the antibody DH1047 described in the study?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus",

        "What potential advantage do nanobodies have over traditional antibodies according to the study?": [
            "They are smaller and more stable, offering advantages in delivery and production",
            "They have a broader range of targets within the virus",
            "They are less specific, allowing for more generalized immune responses",
            "They are easier to produce but less effective in neutralization"
