        "How do circRNAs contribute to the delivery of nanobodies according to the study?": [
            "They offer a novel method for in vivo delivery, allowing sustained expression and secretion of therapeutic antibodies.",
            "They enhance the solubility and stability of nanobodies in vitro.",
            "They facilitate the transport of nanobodies across the blood-brain barrier.",
            "They increase the half-life of nanobodies in the bloodstream."
        ],
        "What are the key advantages of circular RNA vaccines over traditional mRNA vaccines as highlighted in the study?": [
            "Enhanced stability, higher and more durable antigen production, and distinct immune responses.",
            "Lower production costs, easier storage requirements, and faster manufacturing processes.",
            "Increased immunogenicity, broader cross-reactivity with other viruses, and reduced side effects.",
            "Simplified delivery mechanisms, reduced need for adjuvants, and enhanced cellular uptake."
        ],
        "What challenge is highlighted regarding the circRNA-expressed nanobodies' neutralization efficacy against different SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "Reduced activity against the Beta variant compared to the Alpha variant.",
            "Inability to neutralize the Delta variant effectively.",
            "Complete ineffectiveness against the Omicron variant.",
            "Equal efficacy against all tested variants, including Alpha and Beta."

        "What potential broader therapeutic application does the study propose for circRNA-encoded nanobodies beyond SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Targeting intracellular proteins in other viral infections and diseases.",
            "Developing vaccines for bacterial infections.",
            "Enhancing immune responses in autoimmune diseases.",
