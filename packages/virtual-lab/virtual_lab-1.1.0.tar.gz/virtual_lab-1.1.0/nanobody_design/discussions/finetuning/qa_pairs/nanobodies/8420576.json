        "What is the primary advantage of using nanobodies over traditional monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 treatment?": [
            "Nanobodies offer ease of production in microbial systems and high stability.",
            "Nanobodies have a larger size, allowing for more complex interactions.",
            "Nanobodies are derived from human antibodies, ensuring better compatibility.",
            "Nanobodies require more complex production processes, increasing their efficacy."
        ],
        "What potential benefit do nanobody trimers and tandems offer in terms of neutralization potency?": [
            "They enhance binding avidity and match the symmetry of the Spike protein.",
            "They reduce the overall size of the nanobody complex, increasing penetration.",
            "They increase the molecular weight, improving pharmacokinetics.",
            "They decrease the production cost by simplifying the structure."
        ],
        "What structural feature contributes to the high affinity and stability of the nanobodies?": [
            "Extensive contact with the RBD, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and \u03c0-stacking.",
            "Minimal contact with the RBD, relying solely on ionic interactions.",
            "Exclusive binding to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike protein.",
            "Binding primarily through covalent bonds with the Spike protein."
        ],
        "What technique was used to select and characterize the binding affinities of the nanobodies?": [
            "Phage display techniques and bio-layer interferometry (BLI).",
            "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and ELISA.",
            "Flow cytometry and western blotting.",
            "Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation."
        ],
        "Which domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein do the nanobodies target for neutralization?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD).",
            "The N-terminal domain (NTD).",
