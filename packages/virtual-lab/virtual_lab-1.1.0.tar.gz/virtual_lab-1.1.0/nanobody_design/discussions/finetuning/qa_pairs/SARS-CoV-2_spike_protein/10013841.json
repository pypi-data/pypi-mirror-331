        "How does CV-N's binding to the spike protein affect the virus's ability to infect host cells?": [
            "It disrupts the structural integrity or function of the spike protein, preventing viral entry.",
            "It enhances the spike protein's binding to the ACE2 receptor, facilitating viral entry.",
            "It causes the spike protein to detach from the virus, neutralizing it.",
            "It increases the spike protein's affinity for host cell membranes, promoting infection."

        "What is the significance of CV-N's binding to glycosylation sites in terms of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "The conserved nature of glycosylation sites across variants supports CV-N as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.",
            "The glycosylation sites are unique to each variant, limiting CV-N's efficacy to specific strains.",
            "The glycosylation sites mutate rapidly, reducing CV-N's long-term effectiveness.",
            "The glycosylation sites are only present in the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, not in variants."
        ],
        "What is the unique mechanism of action of cyanovirin-N (CV-N) against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "CV-N binds to specific oligosaccharides on the spike protein, inhibiting viral entry without targeting the receptor binding domain.",
            "CV-N directly blocks the ACE2 receptor, preventing viral attachment.",
            "CV-N degrades the spike protein, rendering the virus non-infectious.",
            "CV-N neutralizes the virus by binding to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein."
        ],
        "What potential advantage does CV-N offer when used in combination with other SARS-CoV-2 therapies?": [
            "It provides a complementary approach by targeting glycosylation sites, enhancing overall treatment efficacy.",
            "It competes with existing therapies for the same binding sites, potentially reducing their effectiveness.",
            "It increases the risk of toxicity when combined with other antiviral agents.",
            "It solely targets the receptor binding domain, similar to most existing therapies."
        ],
        "Which glycosylation sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does CV-N bind to?": [
