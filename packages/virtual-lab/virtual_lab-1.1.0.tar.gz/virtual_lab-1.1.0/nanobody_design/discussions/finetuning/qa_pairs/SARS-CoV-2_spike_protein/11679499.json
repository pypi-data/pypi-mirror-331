            "They can bind to unique epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies due to their small size.",
            "They are larger and more complex, allowing for multiple binding sites.",
            "They can only bind to the spike protein's RBD, limiting their use.",
            "They require complex production processes, making them less feasible."
