        "How does nanobody 7A3 contribute to its broad neutralization capability?": [
            "By targeting a highly conserved and deeply buried epitope on the RBD.",
            "By overlapping with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "By binding exclusively to the 'up' conformation of the RBD.",
            "By having a short CDR3 loop that enhances flexibility."
        ],
        "What is the significance of the long CDR3 loop in nanobody 8A2?": [
            "It plays a critical role in interfering with ACE2 binding.",
            "It enhances the binding affinity to the S2 subunit.",
            "It allows the nanobody to bind in both 'up' and 'down' conformations.",
            "It stabilizes the spike protein by bridging two RBDs."
        ],
        "What potential application is suggested for nanobody 7A3 based on its binding properties?": [
            "As a template for designing universal vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.",
            "As a diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "As a delivery vehicle for gene therapy.",
            "As a catalyst for enhancing immune cell activation."

        "What technique was used to isolate the camel-derived nanobodies 7A3 and 8A2?": [
            "Phage display techniques",

            "Hybridoma technology",
            "Yeast surface display"
