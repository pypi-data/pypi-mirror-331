            "Targeted SHMs could enhance the breadth and potency of nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "Targeted SHMs would make nanobodies less stable and less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "Targeted SHMs would limit the ability of nanobodies to neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "Targeted SHMs are unnecessary for nanobodies as they naturally have broad neutralization capabilities."

            "CAB-A17 demonstrates how specific somatic hypermutations enable cross-neutralization of Omicron variants with high potency.",
            "CAB-A17 is an example of an antibody that fails to neutralize Omicron variants due to lack of affinity maturation.",
            "CAB-A17 is used as a negative control in studies of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.",

            "These mutations are critical for maintaining binding to the Omicron RBD despite its mutations.",
            "These mutations are responsible for reducing the binding affinity of CAB-A17 to the Omicron RBD.",
            "These mutations cause CAB-A17 to lose its neutralization capability against all SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
