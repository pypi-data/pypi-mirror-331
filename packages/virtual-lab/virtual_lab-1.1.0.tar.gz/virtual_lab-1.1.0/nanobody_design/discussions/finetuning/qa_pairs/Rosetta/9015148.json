        "How does RosettaSurf differ from traditional protein design methods?": [
            "It emphasizes the optimization of protein surfaces independently of sequence and backbone.",
            "It relies solely on energy-based scoring functions for sequence prediction.",
            "It focuses on the stabilization of protein backbones rather than surfaces.",
            "It uses structurally similar templates as a primary design strategy."
