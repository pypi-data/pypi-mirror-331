            "Nanobodies offer higher stability, greater access to epitopes, and can be nebulized for lung delivery.",
            "Nanobodies have a longer half-life and are more specific to SARS-CoV-2 than IgGs.",

        "What was the mechanism of action for nanobodies like TB202-3 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They blocked the S1-ACE2 interaction by targeting the RBD.",
            "They inhibited viral replication by binding to the nucleocapsid protein.",
            "They disrupted viral entry by targeting the membrane protein.",
