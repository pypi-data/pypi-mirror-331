            "They are smaller and more stable, allowing for better epitope accessibility and potential for inhaled delivery.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream, reducing the frequency of administration.",
            "They can be produced more rapidly and at a lower cost than conventional antibodies.",
