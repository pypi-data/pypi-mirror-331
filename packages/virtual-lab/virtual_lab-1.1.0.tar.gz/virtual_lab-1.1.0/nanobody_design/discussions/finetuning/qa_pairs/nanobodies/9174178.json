        ],
        "What correlation was found regarding the potency of psNbs and their epitope distance from the receptor binding sites?": [
            "A strong negative correlation, with higher potencies for psNbs binding closer to the RBS.",
            "A positive correlation, with higher potencies for psNbs binding further from the RBS.",
            "No correlation, as potency was independent of epitope distance.",
            "A variable correlation depending on the specific sarbecovirus variant."

        "What is the significance of the bispecific psNb (PiN-31) mentioned in the study?": [
            "It combines two distinct psNbs, enhancing its neutralization potency.",
            "It targets a unique epitope not found in other sarbecoviruses.",
            "It is the first nanobody to be successfully tested in human trials.",
            "It is the only nanobody that can be administered orally."
