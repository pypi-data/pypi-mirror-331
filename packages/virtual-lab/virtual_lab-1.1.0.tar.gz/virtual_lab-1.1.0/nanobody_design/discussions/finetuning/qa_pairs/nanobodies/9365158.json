            "RBD-1-2G showed reduced binding to variants with E484 mutations, and affinity maturation or additional panning was suggested to adapt nanobodies.",
            "RBD-1-2G was unable to bind any new variants, and the study suggested abandoning its development.",
            "RBD-1-2G had increased binding to all new variants, requiring no further modifications.",

            "Nanobodies can be produced at a large scale in prokaryotic systems and administered via non-invasive routes such as inhalation or oral delivery.",
            "Nanobodies require mammalian cell systems for production and are typically administered through intravenous injection.",
            "Nanobodies are produced in eukaryotic systems and can only be administered through subcutaneous injection.",
            "Nanobodies are difficult to produce at scale and require complex purification processes for administration."

            "RBD-1-2G can bind the spike protein in both 'up' and 'partial down' conformations.",
            "RBD-1-2G binds exclusively to the 'down' conformation of the spike protein.",
            "RBD-1-2G only interacts with the spike protein when it is in the 'up' conformation.",
            "RBD-1-2G requires the spike protein to be in a 'locked' conformation for binding."

        "What was a significant finding from the molecular dynamics simulations regarding RBD-1-2G's interaction with the spike protein?": [
            "The simulations highlighted key residues involved in binding and showed stable interactions with both the wild-type and B.1.1.7 variant.",
            "The simulations indicated that RBD-1-2G had unstable interactions with the wild-type spike protein.",
            "The simulations revealed that RBD-1-2G could not bind to the B.1.1.7 variant due to structural incompatibility.",
            "The simulations showed that RBD-1-2G had a preference for binding only to the wild-type spike protein."
