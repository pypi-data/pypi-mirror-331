        "What advantage do single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) have over conventional antibodies according to the summary?": [
            "They can bind to cryptic epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, allowing for better stability.",
            "They require a longer development time, ensuring thorough testing.",
            "They are derived from mammals, making them more compatible with human use."

        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described in the summary?": [
            "It facilitates viral entry into host cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "It acts as a protective shell for the viral RNA.",
            "It is responsible for the replication of the virus within host cells.",
            "It provides structural integrity to the virus particle."
