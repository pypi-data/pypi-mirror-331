        "How does the bispecific nanobody dimer 2-3-Fc enhance neutralization potency?": [
            "By targeting distinct epitopes on the receptor-binding domain, allowing simultaneous binding to the same or adjacent RBDs on the spike protein.",
            "By increasing the overall size of the nanobody, which improves its ability to block viral entry.",
            "By incorporating a third nanobody that targets a different viral protein, increasing the breadth of neutralization.",
            "By using a chemical linker that enhances the stability and binding strength of the nanobody dimer."

        "What are the key advantages of nanobodies mentioned in the study?": [
            "Ease of engineering into multivalent formats, thermal resistance, and stability under harsh conditions.",
            "Ability to target multiple viruses simultaneously, high production yield, and low immunogenicity.",
            "High affinity for viral antigens, rapid clearance from the body, and minimal side effects.",
