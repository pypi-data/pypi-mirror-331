        "How were nanobodies engineered in mice according to the study?": [
            "By inserting a cassette of 30 VHH genes from camelids into the mouse genome.",
            "By cross-breeding mice with camelids to naturally produce nanobodies.",
            "By using CRISPR technology to edit mouse antibodies directly.",
            "By injecting mice with camelid antibodies to induce a similar immune response."

        "What distinguishes Group 1 nanobodies from Group 2 nanobodies in their targeting of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Group 1 targets a conserved RBD region, while Group 2 focuses on the RBD-ACE2 interface.",
            "Group 1 targets the spike protein, while Group 2 targets the nucleocapsid protein.",
            "Group 1 is affected by mutations like E484K, while Group 2 is not.",
            "Group 1 nanobodies are monovalent, while Group 2 nanobodies are multivalent."

        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in targeting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes?": [
            "Nanobodies can access epitopes masked by glycan shields due to their smaller size.",
            "Nanobodies have a higher molecular weight, allowing them to bind more strongly.",
            "Nanobodies can only bind to non-conserved regions of the virus.",
            "Nanobodies are less specific, allowing them to bind to a wider range of targets."

        "What is a significant benefit of multimerizing nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization?": [
            "Multimerization enhances avidity and neutralization potency, achieving picomolar IC50 values.",
            "Multimerization reduces the size of nanobodies, allowing them to penetrate cells more easily.",
            "Multimerization increases the immunogenicity of nanobodies, making them more effective.",
            "Multimerization allows nanobodies to bind to non-conserved regions of the virus."
        ],
        "Which characteristic of nanobodies makes them promising candidates for therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Their low immunogenicity and ability to be aerosolized without losing activity.",
            "Their high immunogenicity, which enhances immune system activation.",
            "Their inability to be aerosolized, ensuring they remain stable in the bloodstream.",
            "Their large size, which allows them to cover more surface area on the virus."
