        "What are the advantages of nanobodies over conventional antibodies as described in the study?": [
            "They are small, highly stable, and can penetrate tissues effectively.",
            "They are larger, more complex, and have a broader range of targets.",
            "They are less stable but have a higher binding affinity.",
            "They are more expensive to produce and have limited tissue penetration."
        ],
        "What potential therapeutic application of nanobodies is suggested by the study's findings on nsp-targeting antibodies?": [

        "What role do the identified non-structural proteins (nsps) play in the SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the study?": [

            "They are responsible for viral entry and fusion.",
            "They are involved in capsid formation and viral assembly.",
