        "How do mutations in the spike protein affect vaccine efficacy according to the summary?": [
            "Some variants show reduced neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies.",
            "Mutations increase the binding affinity to ACE2, making vaccines less effective.",
            "Mutations lead to complete vaccine resistance in all variants.",
            "Mutations have no impact on vaccine efficacy."
        ],
        "What characteristic of the Omicron variant's spike protein is highlighted in the summary?": [
            "It has over 30 changes in the spike protein, enhancing immune escape and transmissibility.",
            "It lacks the N501Y mutation but has L452R and T478K.",
            "It shares mutations with the Beta variant, such as E484K and N501Y.",
            "It is characterized by deletions in the N-terminal domain (NTD)."

            "Targeting conserved regions or specific mutations like RBD and NTD to neutralize multiple variants.",
            "Focusing solely on the S2 subunit for enhanced binding.",

        "What is the primary role of the S1 subunit in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the ACE2 receptor on host cells.",
            "It facilitates membrane fusion and viral entry.",
            "It enhances the stability of the spike protein.",
            "It is responsible for the high glycosylation of the spike protein."
