            "They increased the open probability of the ion channels.",
            "They completely blocked the ion channels.",
            "They decreased the open probability of the ion channels.",

        "What is the primary role of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein as described in the study?": [
            "It forms pentameric ion channels that disrupt host cell ion homeostasis.",
            "It directly binds to the host cell DNA to alter gene expression.",
            "It acts as a primary receptor for viral entry into host cells.",
            "It is responsible for the virus's immune evasion by mimicking host proteins."

        "What potential therapeutic application is suggested for nanobodies targeting the E protein?": [
            "They could be used as direct antiviral drugs or as part of vaccine strategies.",
            "They could be used to enhance the immune response to other viral proteins.",
            "They could serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "They could be used to inhibit the replication of other unrelated viruses."
