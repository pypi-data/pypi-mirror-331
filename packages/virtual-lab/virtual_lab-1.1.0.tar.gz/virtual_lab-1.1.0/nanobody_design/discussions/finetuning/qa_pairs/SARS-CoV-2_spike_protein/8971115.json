        "What advantage do trimeric RBD antigens have over monomeric forms in the context of the circRNA vaccines?": [
            "They enhance binding to human ACE2 and improve immunogenicity",
            "They are easier to produce and purify",
            "They are less likely to cause adverse immune reactions",
            "They require lower doses to achieve the same effect"
        ],
        "What is a highlighted benefit of using circRNA for vaccine development over traditional mRNA vaccines?": [
            "Higher stability and longer antigen production due to their covalently closed circular structure",
            "Lower production costs and simpler manufacturing processes",
            "Faster immune response induction and shorter duration of protection",
            "Greater ease of storage and transportation at room temperature"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the circRNA vaccines discussed in the paper?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2"
        ],
        "What potential therapeutic application is mentioned for circRNAs beyond vaccines?": [
            "Expressing therapeutic proteins like nanobodies or hACE2 decoys",
            "Developing antiviral drugs that inhibit viral replication",
            "Creating small interfering RNAs to degrade viral RNA",
            "Producing monoclonal antibodies for passive immunity"
        ],
        "What specific immune response did the circRNA vaccines elicit according to the paper?": [
            "Strong neutralizing antibody responses and Th1-skewed T cell responses",
            "Predominantly Th2-skewed T cell responses",
            "Weak neutralizing antibody responses and Th2-skewed T cell responses",
