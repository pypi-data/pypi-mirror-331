        "What did the cross-docking studies reveal about the engineered nanobodies' specificity to SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "The engineered Nbs maintained high specificity and binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, with minimal cross-reactivity to other viral proteins.",
            "The engineered Nbs showed significant cross-reactivity with influenza haemagglutinins.",
            "The engineered Nbs lost specificity to SARS-CoV-2 and bound to multiple viral proteins.",
            "The engineered Nbs were unable to bind to any SARS-CoV-2 RBDs effectively."
        ],
        "What was the primary reason for selecting HDOCK as the docking program for Nb/RBD interactions?": [
            "HDOCK was selected due to its superior performance in terms of low root mean square deviation (RMSD) and high success rate in generating accurate docking poses.",
            "HDOCK was chosen because it was the fastest program to run simulations.",
            "HDOCK was selected because it was the only program capable of handling large protein complexes.",
            "HDOCK was chosen due to its ability to predict the physicochemical properties of nanobodies."

        "What was the purpose of performing site-directed mutagenesis on the lead nanobodies?": [
            "To enhance their binding affinity and specificity by introducing single-point mutations.",
            "To reduce their molecular weight for better solubility.",
            "To increase their isoelectric points for improved stability.",
            "To change their overall charge to prevent aggregation."

        "Which engineered nanobodies demonstrated the highest binding affinity across all VOC RBDs, suggesting their potential as broad-spectrum neutralizing agents?": [
