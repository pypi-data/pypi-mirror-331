        "How does the multivalent design of minibinders like TRI2\u20132 resist viral escape and antigenic drift?": [
            "By binding multiple sites on the spike protein simultaneously.",
            "By targeting the nucleocapsid protein instead of the spike protein.",
            "By using a single binding site with high affinity.",

        "What is the main advantage of the multivalent minibinder TRI2\u20132 over clinically used monoclonal antibodies?": [
            "It demonstrates superior neutralization potency against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron and Delta.",
            "It can be administered intravenously with higher efficacy.",
            "It targets the nucleocapsid protein instead of the spike protein.",
            "It requires a lower dosage to achieve the same effect as monoclonal antibodies."

        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies and therapeutic interventions in the SARS-CoV-2 virus?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein",

            "The membrane protein",

        "What potential advantage does the small size and stability of minibinders offer for therapeutic application?": [
            "They allow for potential direct nebulization into the respiratory tract.",
            "They require complex intravenous administration.",
            "They are less effective in targeting the spike protein.",
            "They need higher doses to achieve therapeutic effects."

        "What structural feature of TRI2\u20132 was confirmed by Cryo-Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) analysis?": [
            "It forms a tripod on top of the spike protein, engaging all three RBDs.",
            "It binds only one RBD at a time.",
            "It forms a linear chain along the spike protein.",
            "It does not interact with the spike protein at all."
