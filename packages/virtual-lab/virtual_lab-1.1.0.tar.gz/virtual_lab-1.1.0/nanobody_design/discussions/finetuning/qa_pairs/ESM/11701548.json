        "How does BFVD address the limitations of the ESM Atlas according to the summary?": [
            "By providing taxonomic information and a large collection of viral protein structures.",
            "By offering a user-friendly interface for protein structure prediction.",
            "By integrating with existing databases to enhance protein function studies.",
            "By focusing on bacterial rather than viral protein structures."

        "How does BFVD improve the quality of structure predictions as mentioned in the summary?": [
            "By integrating homologous sequences from a vast assemblage of sequence data.",
            "By using a novel machine learning algorithm developed specifically for BFVD.",
            "By focusing on high-resolution imaging techniques.",
