        "What advantage do IgM and IgA antibodies have over IgG in the context of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization?": [
            "They can bind multiple antigens, potentially offering broader neutralization",
            "They are easier to produce and have a longer half-life",
            "They have a higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor",
            "They are more stable at room temperature"
        ],
        "What is a key benefit of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "They can target multiple epitopes, reducing the risk of viral escape",
            "They are less expensive to produce than monoclonal antibodies",
            "They have a longer half-life than single-domain antibodies",
            "They are more effective at inducing systemic immunity"
