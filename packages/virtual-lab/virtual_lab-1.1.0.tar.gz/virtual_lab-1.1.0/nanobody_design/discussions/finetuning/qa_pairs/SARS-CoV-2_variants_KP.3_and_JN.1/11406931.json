        "How did the study's findings relate to the design of nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "The study suggested that understanding specific mutations in spike proteins is crucial for designing effective nanobody binders.",
            "The study indicated that nanobody binders should be designed to target non-spike protein regions.",
            "The study recommended using existing antibody designs without modification for new variants.",
            "The study found that nanobody binders are ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 variants."

        "What did the study conclude about the site of booster administration and its impact on immune response?": [
            "The site of booster administration (ipsilateral or contralateral) did not significantly impact the immune response.",
            "Ipsilateral boosting resulted in a stronger immune response than contralateral boosting.",
            "Contralateral boosting resulted in a stronger immune response than ipsilateral boosting.",
            "The site of booster administration significantly altered the immune response."

        "What was one of the key findings regarding the immune response to different spike protein variants?": [
            "The study identified conserved epitopes across variants that could be targeted for broad neutralization.",
            "The study found that each variant required a completely unique immune response.",
            "The study concluded that no conserved epitopes exist across different variants.",
            "The study suggested that immune responses were highly specific to individual variants without cross-reactivity."
