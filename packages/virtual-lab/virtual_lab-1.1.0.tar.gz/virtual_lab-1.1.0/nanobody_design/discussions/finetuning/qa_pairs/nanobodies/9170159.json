        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies derived from camelid VHH single-domain antibodies compared to conventional antibodies?": [
            "They are smaller and more stable, allowing access to protein cavities inaccessible to larger antibodies.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, providing enhanced structural integrity.",
            "They can only bind to linear epitopes, limiting their application.",
            "They require extensive affinity maturation to achieve high binding affinity."
        ],
        "What is the significance of the distinct epitopes targeted by nanobodies 8A2 and 7A3?": [
            "They allow the nanobodies to be used in combination for enhanced neutralization.",
            "They limit the nanobodies' ability to neutralize multiple variants.",
            "They require the nanobodies to be used separately to avoid interference.",
            "They reduce the overall binding affinity of the nanobodies."

        "What potential application is suggested for the nanobodies in treating COVID-19?": [
            "Development into inhaled drugs for respiratory diseases.",
            "Use as oral medications for systemic infections.",
            "Incorporation into topical creams for skin infections.",
