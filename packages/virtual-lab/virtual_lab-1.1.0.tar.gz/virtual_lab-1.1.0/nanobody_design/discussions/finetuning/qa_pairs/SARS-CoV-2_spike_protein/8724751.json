        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is crucial for binding to the host cell receptor, ACE2.",
            "The S1 subunit is responsible for membrane fusion.",
            "The S1 subunit facilitates the transition from a prefusion to a postfusion state.",
            "The S1 subunit provides structural stability to the spike protein trimer."

        "Why is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) a primary target for neutralizing antibodies?": [
            "Blocking its interaction with ACE2 can prevent viral entry.",
            "It is the most conserved region across coronavirus strains.",
            "It is the largest subunit of the spike protein, providing multiple binding sites.",
            "It is the only region that undergoes conformational changes."
