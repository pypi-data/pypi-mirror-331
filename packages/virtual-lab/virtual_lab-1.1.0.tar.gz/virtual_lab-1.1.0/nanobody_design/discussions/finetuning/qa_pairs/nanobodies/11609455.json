        "How do nanobodies achieve pan-variant efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 according to the paper?": [
            "By targeting conserved regions less prone to mutation.",
            "By rapidly mutating to adapt to new viral strains.",
            "By binding only to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein.",
            "By being administered in combination with traditional vaccines."
        ],
        "What is a significant challenge mentioned in the paper regarding the humanization of nanobodies?": [
            "It can affect their binding properties and requires careful optimization.",
            "It increases their size, making them less effective at targeting hidden epitopes.",
            "It complicates their production in bacterial systems.",
            "It reduces their stability and ease of production."
        ],
        "What is one of the key advantages of nanobodies over conventional monoclonal antibodies in targeting antigens like the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Their small size allows them to access epitopes inaccessible to larger antibodies.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, which increases their binding strength.",
            "They can be produced in mammalian cells, enhancing their stability.",
            "Their complex structure allows for more diverse binding interactions."
        ],
        "What is one of the therapeutic applications of nanobodies beyond SARS-CoV-2 as mentioned in the paper?": [
            "They are being explored for various infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.",
            "They are primarily used in agricultural pest control.",
            "They are limited to diagnostic applications in laboratory settings.",
            "They are used exclusively for vaccine development."
        ],
        "Which technique is highlighted in the paper for identifying diverse nanobody sequences through serum-derived antibodies?": [
            "Mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques.",
            "X-ray crystallography.",
            "Surface plasmon resonance.",
