        "What advantage do nanobodies have over traditional antibodies according to the study?": [
            "They can access hidden epitopes on proteins due to their small size",
            "They have a longer half-life in circulation",
            "They are more stable at high temperatures",
            "They can be produced in eukaryotic systems more easily"
        ],
        "What challenge did the study highlight regarding the use of sdAbs for in vivo applications?": [
            "The short half-life of sdAbs in circulation",
            "The inability of sdAbs to bind to the RBD",
            "The high immunogenicity of sdAbs",
            "The difficulty in producing sdAbs in prokaryotic systems"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the single-domain antibodies developed in the study?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2"
        ],
        "What was the purpose of the focused library (sdAb-RBD) screening in the study?": [
            "To enrich for high-affinity binders with improved specificity for the RBD",
            "To identify binders with broader cross-reactivity against multiple variants",
            "To test the stability of binders in different environmental conditions",
            "To evaluate the solubility of binders in various solvents"
