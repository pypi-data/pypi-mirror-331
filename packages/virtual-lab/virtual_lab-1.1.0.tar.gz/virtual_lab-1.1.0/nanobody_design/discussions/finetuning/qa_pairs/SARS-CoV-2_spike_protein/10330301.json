        "What advantage do nanobodies have over conventional antibodies in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "They can access conserved but less exposed epitopes due to their smaller size and longer CDR3 loops.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, allowing for stronger binding.",
            "They are less specific, allowing them to bind to multiple viral proteins simultaneously.",
            "They are more easily produced in bacterial systems, reducing costs."
        ],
        "What broader implication does the success of nanobodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggest?": [
            "The potential to apply similar strategies to other viral and bacterial pathogens.",
            "The need to abandon traditional antibody therapies in favor of nanobodies.",
            "The requirement for genetic modification of host cells to improve antibody efficacy.",
            "The necessity of developing entirely new classes of antiviral drugs."
        ],
        "What challenge is associated with traditional antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "High sequence variation in the spike protein's RBD leading to escape variants.",
            "Inability to bind to the spike protein due to its small size.",
            "Lack of specificity for the spike protein compared to other viral proteins.",
            "Increased susceptibility to degradation in the bloodstream."
        ],
        "What is a key feature of some identified nanobodies that enhances their therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Ultra-potent binding with picomolar affinities and the ability to neutralize multiple strains.",
            "Ability to bind to the spike protein without requiring any structural modifications.",
            "Increased half-life in the bloodstream compared to traditional antibodies.",
            "Capability to induce a stronger immune response than conventional vaccines."
        ],
        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2, as discussed in the paper?": [
            "The spike protein, specifically the receptor binding domain (RBD).",
            "The nucleocapsid protein, which is crucial for viral replication.",
            "The membrane protein, which is involved in viral assembly.",
