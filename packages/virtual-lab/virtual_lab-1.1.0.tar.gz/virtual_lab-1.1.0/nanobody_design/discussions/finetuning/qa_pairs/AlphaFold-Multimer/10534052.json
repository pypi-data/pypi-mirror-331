            "Use baseline predictions first and apply AFsample for targets where high-confidence models are not achieved.",

        "Why are nanobody interactions particularly challenging to model in multimer predictions?": [
            "Due to their small size and specificity, requiring precise modeling of interactions with antigens.",
            "Because they lack evolutionary information, making predictions difficult.",
            "As they involve complex covalent bonding that is hard to simulate.",
            "Since they are unstable in physiological conditions, complicating structural predictions."
