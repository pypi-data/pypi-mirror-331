            "By linking two or more VHHs targeting various epitopes, their neutralizing ability is significantly enhanced.",
            "By increasing the size of each VHH, allowing them to cover more antigenic sites on the virus.",
            "By incorporating additional light chains to improve binding affinity to the virus.",

        "What are the structural advantages of VHHs over conventional antibodies?": [
            "They consist of a single variable domain, providing high specificity, stability, solubility, and the ability to penetrate tissues.",
            "They have multiple variable domains, allowing for increased binding strength and specificity.",
            "They are composed of both heavy and light chains, enhancing their overall stability and solubility.",
            "They are larger in size, which allows them to cover more antigenic sites simultaneously."

        "What is a key factor in the rapid development and deployment of VHHs for emerging viral threats like SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "The ease of engineering and high yield expression of VHHs.",
            "The natural resistance of VHHs to viral mutations.",
            "The ability of VHHs to naturally neutralize a wide range of viruses without modification.",
            "The inherent long serum half-life of VHHs without any engineering."

        "What makes camelids a potential source of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Their ability to isolate VHHs that bind to different sites on the same target, including hidden antigenic sites.",
            "Their production of antibodies with multiple variable domains that can bind to various strains of SARS-CoV-2.",
