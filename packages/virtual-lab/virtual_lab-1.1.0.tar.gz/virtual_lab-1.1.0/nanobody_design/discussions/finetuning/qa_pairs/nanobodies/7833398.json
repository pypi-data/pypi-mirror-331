        "What are the advantages of nanobodies in terms of size and stability as mentioned in the paper?": [
            "Nanobodies are smaller than conventional antibodies, allowing them to access difficult epitopes and have higher thermal and chemostability.",
            "Nanobodies are larger than conventional antibodies, providing better coverage of the viral surface and increased stability.",
            "Nanobodies are the same size as conventional antibodies but have enhanced stability due to their unique structure.",
            "Nanobodies are smaller than conventional antibodies but have lower stability compared to larger antibodies."

        "What is a suggested therapeutic application of nanobodies according to the paper?": [
            "Nanobodies could be part of antibody cocktails, providing synergistic effects when combined with mAbs targeting different regions of the spike.",
            "Nanobodies could be used as standalone treatments, replacing all existing monoclonal antibody therapies.",
            "Nanobodies could be used exclusively for diagnostic purposes, with no therapeutic applications.",
            "Nanobodies could be used to target host cell proteins instead of viral proteins for therapeutic applications."

        "What potential advantage do nanobodies have in terms of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses?": [
            "Nanobodies targeting conserved regions of the spike, such as the RBD core, may offer cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses.",
            "Nanobodies targeting the RBM are highly cross-reactive with other coronaviruses due to sequence similarity.",
            "Nanobodies targeting the NTD are known for their cross-reactivity with a wide range of coronaviruses.",
            "Nanobodies have no potential for cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses due to their specificity for SARS-CoV-2."

        "Which regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein do nanobodies target according to the paper?": [
            "Nanobodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies target the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the S2 subunit of the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies target the fusion peptide and the heptad repeat regions of the spike protein.",
