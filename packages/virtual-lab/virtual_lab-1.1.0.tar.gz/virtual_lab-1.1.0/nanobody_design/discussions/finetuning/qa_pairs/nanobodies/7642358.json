            "They significantly reduce the development time to 2-3 weeks.",
            "They increase the diversity of binders available.",

            "An unusual spike conformation with two RBDs in the 'up' position.",
            "A novel epitope exposed on the spike protein.",
            "A stabilized 'down' conformation of the RBD.",
