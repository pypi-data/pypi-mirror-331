            "The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) for host cell attachment, while the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion.",

        "What is a key characteristic of nanobodies that makes them suitable for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Nanobodies are small, stable, and can bind to cryptic epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies are large, flexible, and can bind to multiple viral proteins simultaneously.",
            "Nanobodies are unstable but highly specific to a single variant of the virus.",
            "Nanobodies are derived from human antibodies and are primarily used for diagnostic purposes."

        "What is the significance of escape mutations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibody design?": [
            "Escape mutations allow the virus to evade antibody neutralization, impacting vaccine efficacy and therapeutic antibody design.",
            "Escape mutations enhance the virus's ability to replicate, making it more virulent.",
            "Escape mutations increase the virus's susceptibility to existing vaccines and therapeutics.",
            "Escape mutations reduce the virus's transmissibility, making it less of a public health concern."
