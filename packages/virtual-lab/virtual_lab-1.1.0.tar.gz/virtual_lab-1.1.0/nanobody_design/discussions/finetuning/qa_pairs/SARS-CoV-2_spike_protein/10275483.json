        "How do nanobodies enhance their therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 according to the paper?": [
            "By being multivalent, allowing them to bind multiple sites on the spike protein.",
            "By being monovalent, ensuring precise targeting of a single epitope.",
            "By being larger, increasing their binding surface area.",
            "By being unstable, allowing for rapid degradation in the body."
        ],
        "What delivery method for nanobodies is particularly relevant for respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Inhalation due to their small size and stability.",
            "Intravenous injection due to their large size.",
            "Oral administration due to their high acidity.",
            "Topical application due to their skin permeability."
        ],
        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described in the paper?": [
            "Facilitating viral entry into host cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "Providing structural integrity to the virus particle.",
            "Eliciting an immune response in the host.",
            "Replicating the viral RNA within host cells."
        ],
        "What potential application of nanobodies is highlighted beyond therapeutics in the paper?": [
            "Use in diagnostic assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens.",
            "Use in vaccine development to elicit immune responses.",
            "Use in gene therapy to correct viral mutations.",
            "Use in nutritional supplements to boost immunity."
        ],
        "Why are nanobodies considered advantageous over traditional antibodies for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "They are smaller, highly stable, easy to produce, and can recognize unique epitopes.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, making them more effective.",
            "They are derived from human antibodies, reducing immunogenicity.",
            "They require complex production systems, increasing specificity."
