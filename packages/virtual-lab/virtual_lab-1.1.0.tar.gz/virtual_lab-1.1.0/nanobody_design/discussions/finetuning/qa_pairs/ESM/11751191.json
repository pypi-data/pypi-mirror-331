        "How does DNMS contribute to the design of nanobody binders according to the paper?": [
            "By predicting likely future mutations, it informs the design of nanobodies that are robust against anticipated changes in the spike protein",
            "By providing real-time data on current mutations, it helps in immediate nanobody design adjustments",
            "By analyzing past mutations, it aids in understanding historical nanobody efficacy",
            "By focusing on non-spike proteins, it diversifies the targets for nanobody binders"
        ],
        "What advantage did ProtBERT have over ESM models in the study?": [
            "Better overall prediction accuracy in DNMS due to superior grammaticality",
            "Higher semantic and attention change metrics",
            "Faster computational speed and efficiency",
            "Greater ability to handle large protein databases"

        "What role do attention mechanisms play in the transformer models used in the study?": [
            "They provide insights into which parts of the protein sequence are most relevant for maintaining structural integrity and function",
            "They enhance the speed of mutation prediction by focusing on key sequence areas",
            "They improve the model's ability to predict non-structural protein mutations",
            "They allow the model to ignore irrelevant parts of the protein sequence, reducing computational load"
