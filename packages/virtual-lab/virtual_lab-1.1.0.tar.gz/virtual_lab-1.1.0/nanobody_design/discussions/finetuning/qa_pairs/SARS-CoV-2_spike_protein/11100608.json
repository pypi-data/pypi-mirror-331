        "What is the main advantage of targeting non-supersite epitopes in the NTD according to the study?": [
            "They are less prone to mutations, making them promising for broad-spectrum neutralization.",
            "They are more accessible for antibody binding, increasing neutralization potency.",
            "They enhance the immune response by activating T-cell mediated immunity.",
            "They allow for easier production and purification of antibodies."
        ],
        "What is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and why is it significant?": [
            "The RBD, due to its role in binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells.",
            "The NTD, because it is the main site for viral entry into host cells.",
            "The S2 subunit, as it is crucial for membrane fusion during viral entry.",
            "The glycan shield, since it provides protection against immune recognition."
        ],
        "What structural insight does the study provide for the design of effective nanobody binders?": [
            "Targeting conserved and less mutable regions of the spike protein.",
            "Focusing on highly mutable regions to adapt to viral evolution.",
            "Prioritizing the glycan shield for enhanced immune evasion.",
            "Designing nanobodies that exclusively target the S2 subunit."
        ],
        "What was the outcome of combining NTD-specific C1596 with RBD-specific antibodies in bispecific constructs?": [
            "Potent neutralization against all tested Omicron variants, including XBB.1.5, EG.5.1, and BA.2.86.",
            "Increased susceptibility to escape mutations in circulating strains.",
            "Reduced neutralization potency compared to parental antibodies used alone.",
            "Limited efficacy against non-Omicron variants of concern."
        ],
        "Which specific NTD-targeting antibody was identified as having broad binding specificity and neutralization potency against various VOCs, including Omicron variants?": [
