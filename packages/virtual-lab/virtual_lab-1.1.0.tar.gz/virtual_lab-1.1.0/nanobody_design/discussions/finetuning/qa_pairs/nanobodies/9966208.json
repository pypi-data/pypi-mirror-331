        "How did the study enhance the soluble expression of the SARS VHH-72 nanobody?": [
            "By engineering it with a small ubiquitin-like modifier (Smt3) tag.",
            "By fusing it with a fluorescent protein tag.",
            "By expressing it in a mammalian cell system.",
            "By increasing its molecular weight through glycosylation."
        ],
        "What are the key advantages of using nanobodies over conventional antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization?": [
            "Nanobodies have a small size and high stability, allowing them to access more epitopes.",
            "Nanobodies have a larger size, which increases their binding strength.",
            "Nanobodies are derived from human antibodies, making them more compatible with human immune systems.",
            "Nanobodies have a complex structure that enhances their specificity."
        ],
        "What dual purpose do the nanobody-linked immunoliposomes serve in the study?": [
            "Neutralizing the virus and delivering antivirals directly to the site of infection.",
            "Increasing the size of the virus and preventing its replication.",
            "Binding to the virus and marking it for destruction by immune cells.",
            "Blocking the virus from entering cells and enhancing antibody production."
        ],
        "What potential advantage do nanobody-based immunoliposomes have against various SARS-CoV-2 strains?": [
            "They can target conserved regions of the spike protein.",
            "They can mutate rapidly to adapt to new strains.",
            "They can be easily modified to change their target.",
            "They can increase the mutation rate of the virus."
        ],
        "What was the observed effect of the Smt3 tag on the nanobody's binding efficiency?": [
            "The Smt3 tag hindered the binding efficiency of the nanobody.",
            "The Smt3 tag enhanced the binding efficiency of the nanobody.",
            "The Smt3 tag had no effect on the binding efficiency of the nanobody.",
            "The Smt3 tag completely prevented the nanobody from binding."
