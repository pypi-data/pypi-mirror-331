        "How were the nanobodies R14 and S43 initially isolated according to the study?": [
            "From alpacas immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD proteins",
            "From llamas exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein",
            "From mice vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein",
            "From rabbits injected with the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein"
        ],
        "What are the main advantages of nanobodies over conventional antibodies as described in the study?": [
            "Increased stability, ease of manipulation, and ability to penetrate barriers like the respiratory epithelium",
            "Higher molecular weight and longer half-life in circulation",
            "Broader range of antigen recognition and higher specificity",
            "Lower production cost and faster clearance from the body"
        ],
        "What distinct binding mechanism does R14 utilize to block the interaction with the ACE2 receptor?": [
            "R14 binds to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD",
            "R14 targets a cryptic epitope on the spike protein",
            "R14 binds to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein",
            "R14 interacts with the fusion peptide region of the spike protein"
        ],
        "What was the primary reason for engineering R14 and S43 into multivalent forms?": [
            "To enhance the neutralizing potency and breadth of activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants",
            "To reduce the production cost and increase the yield of nanobodies",
            "To improve the pharmacokinetics and extend the half-life of nanobodies",
            "To decrease the immunogenicity and potential side effects of nanobodies"
        ],
        "Which nanobody form showed the most significant enhancement in neutralizing activity against Omicron sub-variants?": [
            "The decameric form MR14",
