        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the ACE2 receptor.",
            "It is responsible for membrane fusion following receptor binding.",
            "It stabilizes the spike protein in its 'down' conformation.",
