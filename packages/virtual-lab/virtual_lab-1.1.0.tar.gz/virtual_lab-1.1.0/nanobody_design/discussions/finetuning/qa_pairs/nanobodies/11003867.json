        "How does the study suggest nanobodies could be engineered to enhance SARS-CoV-2 immunity?": [
            "Nanobodies could be engineered to enhance or mimic T cell-mediated immunity.",
            "Nanobodies could be designed to directly neutralize the virus by binding to its spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies could be used to suppress T cell responses to prevent overactive immune reactions.",
            "Nanobodies could be engineered to replace antibodies in the immune response entirely."
        ],
        "How might nanobodies contribute to future vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Nanobodies could serve as adjuvants or components of vaccines that specifically boost T cell-mediated immunity.",
            "Nanobodies could replace traditional vaccines by providing complete protection through passive immunity.",
            "Nanobodies could be used to inhibit T cell responses to prevent autoimmune reactions post-vaccination.",
            "Nanobodies could be incorporated into vaccines to enhance the production of neutralizing antibodies."
        ],
        "What is the purpose of the hybrid human/mouse ACE2 model mentioned in the study?": [
            "It is used to evaluate the cross-reactivity and effectiveness of nanobodies against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "It is designed to test the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus in a controlled environment.",
            "It serves as a model to study the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 between species.",
            "It is used to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on organ systems."
        ],
        "What is the significance of Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in the context of T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "IFN-\u03b3 is important for T cell-mediated protection, and nanobodies could be designed to enhance its production or function.",
            "IFN-\u03b3 is a marker of antibody production and is not directly involved in T cell responses.",
            "IFN-\u03b3 is primarily involved in the regulation of B cell activity rather than T cell responses.",
            "IFN-\u03b3 is only relevant in the context of innate immune responses, not adaptive immunity."
        ],
        "What role do T cells play in providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 according to the study?": [
            "T cells, particularly CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, are critical for providing protection against SARS-CoV-2, especially when antibody responses are insufficient.",
            "T cells are primarily responsible for producing antibodies that neutralize the virus.",
            "T cells are involved in the initial recognition of the virus but do not play a significant role in long-term immunity.",
            "T cells are only important for individuals who have not been vaccinated or previously infected."
