        "What advantage do nanobodies have over conventional antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They are less susceptible to antigenic drift due to targeting conserved regions.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "They are more effective at inducing an immune response.",
            "They can be produced in larger quantities than conventional antibodies."

        "What is a key characteristic of nanobodies that makes them suitable for targeting cryptic epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Their small size allows them to access cryptic epitopes.",
            "They have a high affinity for the ACE2 receptor.",

            "They bind directly to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "They are derived from humanized mice.",
