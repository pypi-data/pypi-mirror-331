        "From which animal was Nanosota-9 derived?": [
            "An alpaca",

        "How does Nanosota-9 enhance its neutralization potency against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "By crosslinking two RBDs, locking one in a 'lying-down' position and the other in a 'standing-up' position",
            "By binding exclusively to the 'standing-up' conformation of the RBD",
            "By targeting the S2 subunit to prevent membrane fusion",
            "By binding to the N-terminal domain to block spike protein trimerization"
        ],
        "What is one advantage of nanobodies like Nanosota-9 over conventional antibodies?": [
            "Their smaller size allows access to conserved, cryptic epitopes",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream",
            "They can be easily administered orally",
            "They are less likely to cause allergic reactions"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of Nanosota-9 on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD)",
            "The S2 subunit",
            "The N-terminal domain",
            "The fusion peptide"
