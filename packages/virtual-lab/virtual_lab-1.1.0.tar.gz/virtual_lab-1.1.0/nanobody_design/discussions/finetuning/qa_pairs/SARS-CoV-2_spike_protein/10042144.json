        "Why are nanobodies considered advantageous for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Due to their small size, stability, and ease of production.",
            "Because they can be easily integrated into existing vaccine platforms.",
            "Because they are naturally resistant to viral mutations.",
            "Due to their ability to degrade viral RNA directly."
