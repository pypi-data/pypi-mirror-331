        "What advantage do nanobodies offer in targeting conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Their small size and stability allow for better delivery and tissue penetration.",
            "They are more effective at binding to variable regions.",
            "They can only target the N-terminal domain.",
            "They are less stable than traditional antibodies."

            "It is conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1, indicating potential for cross-sarbecovirus neutralization.",
            "It is highly variable, making it prone to escape mutations.",
            "It is unique to the Omicron variant, providing specific neutralization.",
            "It is located in the N-terminal domain, which is less critical for viral entry."
