        "How does the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system improve the Luminex assay's sensitivity?": [
            "By ensuring oriented immobilization of sdAbs on MagPlex beads",
            "By increasing the size of the nanobodies for better detection",
            "By allowing non-specific binding to various proteins",
            "By reducing the need for bead-based assays"
        ],
        "What is a key advantage of using nanobodies in diagnostic assays as mentioned in the summary?": [
            "Their small size allows them to access hidden epitopes",
            "They have a larger size that enhances binding strength",
            "They are derived from human antibodies, reducing immunogenicity",
            "They require complex mammalian expression systems for production"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the single domain antibody-based Luminex assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection?": [
            "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2",

        "What potential application does the MagPlex bead platform offer for the sdAb-based assay?": [
            "Multiplexing for simultaneous detection of multiple targets",
            "Single-target detection to increase specificity",
            "Reduction in assay time by eliminating washing steps",
