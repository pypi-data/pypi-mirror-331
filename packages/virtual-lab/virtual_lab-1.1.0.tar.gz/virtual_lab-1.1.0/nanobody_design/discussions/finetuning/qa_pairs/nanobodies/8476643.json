        "What structural feature allows 7D6 and 6D6 to maintain neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "They target a conserved site that is not affected by common mutations in circulating variants.",
            "They bind to a highly variable site that adapts to mutations.",
            "They interact with the spike protein through non-specific hydrophobic interactions.",
            "They rely on a flexible binding loop that adjusts to variant changes."

        "Which specific site do the antibodies 7D6 and 6D6 target on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "A cryptic site on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) distinct from the receptor-binding motif (RBM).",
