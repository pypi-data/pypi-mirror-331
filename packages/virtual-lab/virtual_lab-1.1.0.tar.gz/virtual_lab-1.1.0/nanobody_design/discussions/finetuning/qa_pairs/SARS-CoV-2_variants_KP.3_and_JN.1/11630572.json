        "How was Nanosota-9 initially identified?": [
            "From an alpaca immunized with the Omicron BA.5 spike protein.",
            "Through computational modeling of potential nanobody structures.",
            "By screening a human antibody library for cross-reactivity.",
            "From a mouse model immunized with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain."
        ],
        "What is the primary mechanism by which Nanosota-9 neutralizes Omicron subvariants?": [
            "By crosslinking two receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the spike protein, preventing ACE2 receptor binding.",
            "By directly binding to the ACE2 receptor, blocking the spike protein from attaching.",
            "By degrading the spike protein through enzymatic activity.",
            "By inducing a conformational change in the spike protein that prevents its expression on the viral surface."
        ],
        "What potential advantage does Nanosota-9 have over conventional antibodies?": [
            "Its small size and ability to access cryptic epitopes.",
            "Its ability to induce a stronger immune response.",
            "Its longer half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "Its capacity to be produced in larger quantities."
        ],
        "What structural feature of Nanosota-9 contributes to its broad-spectrum activity against Omicron subvariants?": [
            "Binding to conserved epitopes on the RBDs, overlapping significantly with the ACE2 binding site.",
            "Binding exclusively to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein.",
            "Targeting the S2 subunit of the spike protein for enhanced stability.",
