        "How does NB1B11 neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus?": [
            "By binding directly to the ACE2-binding site on the RBD, preventing ACE2 interaction.",
            "By forming a \u03b2-strand interaction with the RBD, interfering with local conformation.",
            "By binding to a conserved epitope shared with SARS-CoV-1.",
            "By enhancing the hinge-like movements of the RBD to prevent ACE2 binding."

        "What advantage do camelid-derived nanobodies have over traditional antibodies?": [
            "Their small size and ease of engineering into multivalent formats.",
            "Their ability to bind multiple epitopes simultaneously.",
            "Their longer half-life in the bloodstream.",

            "Some mutations, such as those in the Omicron variant, may reduce its effectiveness.",
            "It cannot bind to the ACE2-binding site on the RBD.",
            "It is unable to form multivalent formats.",
            "It lacks cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1."

        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the host cell receptor ACE2.",
            "It facilitates membrane fusion during viral entry.",
            "It provides structural stability to the spike protein.",
            "It acts as a decoy to evade the host immune response."
