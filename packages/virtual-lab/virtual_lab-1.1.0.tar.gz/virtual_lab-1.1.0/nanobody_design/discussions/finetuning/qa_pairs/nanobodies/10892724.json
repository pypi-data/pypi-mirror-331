        "What is one of the key advantages of llama-derived nanobodies over conventional monoclonal antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 treatment?": [
            "They can cross the blood-brain barrier.",
            "They are larger in size, allowing for better binding.",
            "They have higher immunogenicity, enhancing immune response.",
            "They require more complex production processes."

        "What potential benefit does the cocktail approach of combining different nanobodies offer in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "It enhances neutralization efficacy and prevents viral escape.",
            "It increases the size of the nanobodies for better binding.",
            "It reduces the production cost of nanobodies.",
