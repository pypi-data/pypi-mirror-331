        "What is the primary advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in terms of production?": [
            "They can be produced in bacteria or yeast, which is more cost-effective.",
            "They can be produced in mammalian cells, which is faster.",
            "They require less purification, reducing production time.",
            "They can be synthesized chemically, avoiding biological systems."
