        "How are nanobodies used in diagnostic applications according to the summary?": [
            "In assays like sandwich ELISA for detecting the Spike protein.",
            "As fluorescent markers for imaging viral particles.",
            "In PCR assays to amplify viral RNA.",
            "As contrast agents in MRI scans for detecting infections."

        "What is one advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies as mentioned in the summary?": [
            "Their small size, stability, and ease of production.",
            "Their ability to induce a stronger immune response.",
            "Their longer half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "Their higher specificity for non-viral antigens."
        ],
        "What is the primary mechanism by which nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 according to the summary?": [
            "By binding to the Spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) and preventing its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.",
            "By directly degrading the viral RNA genome inside host cells.",
            "By inducing apoptosis in infected host cells through immune activation.",
            "By blocking the viral fusion process with host cell membranes."
        ],
        "What potential issue is highlighted for nanobodies that rely on interactions with residues like E484?": [
            "They may be susceptible to escape mutations seen in variants like the Beta variant.",
            "They may cause adverse immune reactions in patients.",
            "They might not be effective against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.",
            "They could interfere with the host's natural immune response."
