            "It allows for rapid identification of nanobodies with broad neutralizing activity using minimal antigen quantities.",
            "It ensures the production of nanobodies with higher affinity for the target antigen.",
            "It guarantees that the identified nanobodies will have no cross-reactivity with other proteins.",
