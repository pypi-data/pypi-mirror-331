        "How does the study suggest enhancing the neutralization potency of nanobodies?": [
            "By designing nanobodies that can crosslink and aggregate viral particles.",
            "By focusing solely on the ACE2 binding site.",
            "By increasing the size of the nanobodies.",
            "By targeting only the N-terminal domain of the spike protein."
        ],
        "What is a key implication for therapeutic applications derived from the study's findings?": [
            "Nanobodies should be designed with both potency and breadth of specificity to offer robust protection.",
            "Nanobodies should target only the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain for maximum efficacy.",
            "Nanobodies should be engineered to bind exclusively to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "Nanobodies should avoid targeting the spike protein to prevent immune escape."

        "What is the unique binding mechanism exhibited by TAU-2212 that enhances its neutralization capability?": [
            "TAU-2212 exhibits multiple conformations allowing it to crosslink spike proteins and stabilize the 'down' RBD conformation.",
            "TAU-2212 binds exclusively to the ACE2 binding site, preventing viral entry.",
            "TAU-2212 uses a single conformation to block the spike protein's fusion peptide.",
            "TAU-2212 targets the N-terminal domain of the spike protein to inhibit viral replication."

        "What structural feature of TAU-2212 provides insights for nanobody engineering?": [
            "Its ability to crosslink and aggregate viral particles.",
            "Its exclusive binding to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "Its single conformation binding mode.",
            "Its interaction with the viral RNA genome."

        "Why are antibodies targeting non-ACE2 binding sites considered advantageous in terms of cross-reactivity?": [
            "They tend to retain broader activity across different variants.",
            "They have a higher affinity for the spike protein.",
            "They are less likely to induce immune escape mutations.",
            "They exclusively neutralize the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain."
