            "It disrupts an interprotomer contact, facilitating the RBD's transition to the up conformation, which is essential for ACE2 binding.",

            "Nanobodies could be engineered to preferentially bind to the stabilized spike conformation, potentially blocking the receptor binding domain (RBD) from adopting the up conformation necessary for ACE2 interaction.",

        "What role does the D614G mutation play in the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It enhances the stability of the spike protein in its cleaved form on the surface of virions.",

            "It has no effect on the stability of the spike protein but increases its fusogenicity.",
