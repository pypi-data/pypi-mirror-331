        "How does the multivalent nature of VNPs contribute to enhanced neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses?": [
            "It increases avidity due to the multivalent presentation of nanobodies on the VNP surface.",
            "It reduces the size of the VNPs, allowing for better penetration into cells.",
            "It changes the charge of the VNPs, improving their interaction with viral particles.",
            "It alters the shape of the VNPs, facilitating better binding to the virus."
        ],
        "What are the two specific nanobodies used in the study to target the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain?": [
            "VHH-72 (VHH1) and Ty1 (VHH2)",
            "VHH-60 (VHH1) and Ty2 (VHH2)",

        "What is the role of picornavirus 2A peptides in the study's VNP platform?": [
            "They allow for the modulation of nanobody decoration on the VNPs.",
            "They enhance the binding affinity of nanobodies to the VNPs.",
            "They increase the production yield of VNPs in plants.",
            "They stabilize the VNPs during storage and transport."

        "What technique was used to confirm the correct assembly and functionality of the nanobody-decorated VNPs?": [
            "Immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)",
            "X-ray crystallography and Western blotting",
