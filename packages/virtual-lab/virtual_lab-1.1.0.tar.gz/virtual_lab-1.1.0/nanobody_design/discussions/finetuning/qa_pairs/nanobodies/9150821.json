        "How did the study enhance the binding affinity and neutralization potency of nanobodies targeting HIV-1?": [
            "By engineering bivalent and trivalent nanobodies using flexible glycine-serine linkers",
            "By increasing the size of the nanobodies to improve epitope coverage",
            "By using rigid linkers to stabilize the nanobody structure",
            "By reducing the number of binding sites to focus on high-affinity interactions"

        "What implication does the study suggest for designing SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders?": [
            "Designing multivalent nanobody constructs could enhance binding and neutralization by increasing avidity",
            "Using monovalent constructs is sufficient for effective neutralization",

        "What is a key characteristic of nanobodies that allows them to bind cryptic epitopes?": [
            "Their long complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)",
            "Their large size compared to conventional antibodies",
            "Their ability to form multivalent constructs",

            "They did not always enhance neutralization compared to monovalent or bivalent forms",
            "They consistently showed superior neutralization compared to all other forms",
            "They were unable to bind multiple epitopes simultaneously",
            "They were less stable than monovalent constructs"

        "What was the purpose of fusing nanobodies to the IgG1 Fc domain in the study?": [
            "To extend half-life, enhance neutralization, and enable Fc-mediated effector functions",
            "To decrease the molecular weight for better tissue penetration",
            "To prevent the nanobodies from binding to non-target proteins",
