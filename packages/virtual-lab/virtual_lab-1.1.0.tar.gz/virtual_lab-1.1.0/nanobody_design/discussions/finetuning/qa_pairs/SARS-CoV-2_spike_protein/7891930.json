        "How does the G614 variant affect the proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein?": [
            "The G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, allowing more functional Spike proteins on the virion surface.",
            "The G614 variant is more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, reducing the number of functional Spike proteins.",
            "The G614 variant shows no change in proteolytic cleavage resistance compared to the D614 variant.",
            "The G614 variant completely prevents proteolytic cleavage, leading to non-functional Spike proteins."

        "What concern does the emergence of the G614 variant raise for vaccine development?": [
            "The efficacy of vaccines based on the original D614 Spike sequence may be compromised.",
            "The G614 variant may evade all known neutralizing antibodies.",
            "The G614 variant requires entirely new vaccine platforms to be developed.",
            "The G614 variant does not affect vaccine efficacy, as it does not alter the Spike protein structure."

        "What is the primary impact of the D614G mutation on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity according to the study?": [
            "It increases viral entry efficiency by up to eightfold compared to the D614 variant.",
            "It significantly enhances ACE2 receptor binding affinity.",
            "It reduces the overall virulence of the virus in human cell types.",
            "It decreases the stability of the Spike protein on the virion surface."
