        "How does avidity engineering contribute to the effectiveness of the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "By increasing valency, enhancing the apparent affinity for the target antigen",
            "By reducing the size of the antibody, allowing better tissue penetration",
            "By altering the Fc region to improve effector function recruitment",

        "What is a key benefit of using single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) derived from camelids and sharks in antibody engineering?": [
            "Their single-chain format simplifies the creation of multimeric and multispecific antibodies",
            "They have a higher natural affinity for human proteins",
            "They are less likely to induce an immune response in humans",

            "Enhanced neutralization potency and breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants",
            "Reduced production cost and increased stability",
            "Improved solubility and faster clearance from the body",
            "Increased specificity and reduced off-target effects"
