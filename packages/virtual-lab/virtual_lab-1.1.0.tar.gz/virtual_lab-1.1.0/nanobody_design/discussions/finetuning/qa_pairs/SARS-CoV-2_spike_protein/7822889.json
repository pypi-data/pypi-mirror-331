        "How does the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology contribute to the vaccine's design?": [
            "It multimerizes the RBD on a VLP platform, enhancing its presentation to the immune system.",
            "It directly binds to the ACE2 receptor, blocking viral entry.",
            "It degrades the viral RNA, preventing replication.",
            "It encapsulates the virus, preventing it from infecting host cells."
        ],
        "What advantage does the RBD-SpyVLP vaccine have in terms of distribution and storage?": [
            "It is thermostable and can be lyophilized without losing immunogenicity.",
            "It requires refrigeration at all times to maintain stability.",
            "It must be stored in liquid nitrogen to preserve its efficacy.",
            "It loses potency if exposed to temperatures above freezing."
        ],
        "What is the primary focus of the vaccine candidate discussed in the study?": [
            "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",
            "The full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2."
        ],
        "What potential application does the study suggest for the RBD-SpyVLP vaccine beyond vaccination?": [
            "As a therapeutic agent, either standalone or in combination with other treatments.",
            "As a diagnostic tool for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections.",
            "As a dietary supplement to boost general immunity.",
            "As a topical antiseptic for disinfecting surfaces."
        ],
        "What type of antibody response does the RBD-SpyVLP vaccine induce?": [
            "A polyclonal antibody response targeting multiple epitopes on the RBD.",
            "A monoclonal antibody response targeting a single epitope on the RBD.",
            "An antibody response targeting the S2 subunit of the spike protein.",
            "An antibody response that primarily targets the nucleocapsid protein."
