        "How does Nanosota-1C differ from ACE2 in terms of binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Nanosota-1C can bind to both open and closed conformations of the spike protein, while ACE2 can only bind in the open conformation.",
            "Nanosota-1C binds exclusively to the closed conformation, whereas ACE2 binds to both conformations.",
            "Nanosota-1C binds only to the open conformation, similar to ACE2.",
            "Nanosota-1C does not bind to the spike protein, unlike ACE2."
        ],
        "What advantage does Nanosota-1C-Fc have in terms of production and stability for therapeutic applications?": [
            "It can be produced at high yields in bacteria, is cost-effective, exhibits exceptional thermostability, and has a long in vivo half-life.",
            "It requires mammalian cell culture for production, which is costly but ensures high stability.",
            "It is unstable at high temperatures but can be produced quickly in yeast systems.",
            "It has a short in vivo half-life but can be produced in large quantities using plant-based systems."
        ],
        "What is the binding affinity (Kd) of the final nanobody construct, Nanosota-1C-Fc, to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "15.7 picomolar, approximately 3000 times tighter than ACE2.",
            "150 nanomolar, similar to the binding affinity of ACE2.",
            "1.5 micromolar, weaker than the binding affinity of ACE2.",
            "157 picomolar, slightly tighter than ACE2."

        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described in the study?": [
            "Facilitating viral entry into host cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor and enabling membrane fusion.",
            "Providing structural support to the virus and maintaining its integrity.",
            "Acting as an enzyme to degrade host cell defenses.",
            "Serving as a storage site for viral genetic material."
        ],
        "Why is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein considered a critical target for therapeutic interventions?": [
            "It is directly involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor, and blocking this interaction can prevent viral entry into host cells.",
            "It is responsible for the replication of the viral genome within host cells.",
            "It acts as a decoy to distract the host immune system from the virus.",
            "It is the primary site for viral assembly and release from host cells."
