            "They bind to overlapping epitopes on the RBD to enhance viral entry.",

        "Why is the dual targeting strategy of Sb#15 and Sb#68 important in preventing viral escape mutations?": [
            "It engages multiple critical sites on the virus, reducing the chance of escape mutations.",
            "It focuses on a single epitope, making it harder for the virus to mutate.",
