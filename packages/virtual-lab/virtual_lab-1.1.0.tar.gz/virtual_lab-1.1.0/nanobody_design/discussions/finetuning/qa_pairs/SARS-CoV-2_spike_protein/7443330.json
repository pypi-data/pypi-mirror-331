        "What is a significant advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in therapeutic applications?": [
            "They are small, stable, and can be engineered to enhance binding affinity and specificity.",
            "They have a larger size, allowing for more robust immune responses.",
            "They naturally include effector functions that enhance therapeutic potential.",
            "They are derived from human antibodies, reducing the risk of immune rejection."

        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) crucial for binding to the host receptor ACE2.",
            "It is responsible for membrane fusion during viral entry.",
            "It undergoes proteolytic cleavage by host proteases.",
            "It facilitates the trimerization of the spike protein."
        ],
        "What potential therapeutic strategy is suggested for enhancing the efficacy of nanobodies?": [
            "Using them in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as small molecules or peptides.",
            "Increasing their size to improve binding to the RBD.",
            "Engineering them to include the Fc region for enhanced immune recruitment.",
            "Targeting the S2 subunit instead of the RBD for better viral neutralization."
        ],
        "Why are nanobodies considered safer in terms of avoiding antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)?": [
            "Nanobodies lack the Fc region, which means they do not mediate ADE.",
            "Nanobodies have a higher binding affinity to the RBD, reducing ADE risk.",
            "Nanobodies are derived from camelid antibodies, which naturally avoid ADE.",
            "Nanobodies can be engineered to include effector functions that prevent ADE."
