        "What is the primary advantage of camelid nanobodies over traditional antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They can access epitopes that are typically inaccessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "They have a higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor.",
            "They are more effective against bacterial infections.",
            "They can be produced more quickly than traditional antibodies."
        ],
        "What potential therapeutic application do the identified nanobodies have according to the study?": [
            "They could be used as therapeutic agents in immunocompromised patients.",
            "They could replace vaccines for the general population.",
            "They are intended for use in treating bacterial infections.",

            "Higher somatic hypermutation correlated with broader neutralization.",

            "Somatic hypermutation had no effect on neutralization breadth.",
            "Somatic hypermutation decreased neutralization breadth."

            "Single immunization of a llama with a cocktail of RBD variants.",
