        "What advantage do nanobodies have over full-sized antibodies in therapeutic applications?": [
            "They can access cryptic epitopes due to their small size.",
            "They have a higher mutation rate, allowing for rapid adaptation.",
            "They engage Fc receptors more effectively to mediate effector functions.",
            "They are less stable and harder to produce, reducing production costs."
        ],
        "What challenge does the high mutation rate in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pose for nanobody design?": [
            "It necessitates designs that can accommodate or resist changes to maintain efficacy.",
            "It makes the RBD less immunogenic compared to other regions.",
            "It reduces the stability and ease of production of nanobodies.",
            "It limits the ability of nanobodies to access cryptic epitopes."
        ],
        "What is one mechanism by which nanobodies can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus?": [
            "By blocking receptor binding and preventing viral entry.",
            "By increasing the mutation rate of the spike protein.",
            "By enhancing the immunogenicity of the S2 subunit.",
            "By reducing the conservation of the spike protein across coronaviruses."
        ],
        "What is the primary function of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "It contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for binding to the host cell receptor ACE2.",
            "It mediates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.",
            "It is involved in the shedding of the S1 subunit.",
            "It engages Fc receptors to mediate effector functions."
        ],
        "Why is the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein considered a potential target for broadly neutralizing antibodies?": [
            "It is more conserved across coronaviruses.",
            "It has a high mutation rate, especially in the receptor-binding motif.",
            "It is highly dynamic, existing in 'up' and 'down' conformations.",
            "It is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies due to its role in viral entry."
