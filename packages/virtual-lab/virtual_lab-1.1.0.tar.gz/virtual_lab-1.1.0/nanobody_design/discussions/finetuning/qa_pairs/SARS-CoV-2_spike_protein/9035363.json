        "How does LY-CoV1404's binding site contribute to its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "The binding site is largely conserved across variants",
            "The binding site is highly variable across variants",
            "The binding site is located outside the RBD",
            "The binding site is unique to each variant"
        ],
        "What advantage does LY-CoV1404 have in terms of dosage for therapeutic use?": [
            "It can be used in lower doses due to its high potency",
            "It requires higher doses due to limited potency",
            "It is ineffective at low doses and requires combination therapy",
            "It is only effective in high doses due to rapid clearance"
        ],
        "What is the primary target of the LY-CoV1404 antibody on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "The receptor binding domain (RBD)",
            "The N-terminal domain (NTD)",
            "The S2 subunit",
            "The fusion peptide"
