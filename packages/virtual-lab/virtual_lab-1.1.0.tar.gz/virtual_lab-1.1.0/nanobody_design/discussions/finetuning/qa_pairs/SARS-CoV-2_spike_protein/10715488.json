        "What challenge did the researchers face when measuring the binding affinity of S2A9?": [
            "Traditional methods like Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) were ineffective",
            "The VNAR antibodies were too large to penetrate antigenic pockets",
            "The S2 subunit was too variable across different variants",
            "The S2A9 antibody showed no binding to the spike protein"
        ],
        "What future direction is suggested for the development of S2A9?": [
            "Structural studies to map the binding site on the S2 subunit",
            "Focusing on the S1 subunit for improved efficacy",
            "Developing a new phage display library",
            "Increasing the mutation rate of the S2 subunit"
        ],
        "What is the primary focus of the study regarding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Targeting the S2 subunit with nurse shark VNAR antibodies",
            "Investigating the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit",
            "Developing vaccines targeting the S1 subunit",
            "Analyzing the mutation rate of the S1 subunit"
        ],
        "What is the significance of the VNAR antibody S2A9 identified in the study?": [
            "It shows broad neutralization activity against all variants of concern from alpha to omicron",
            "It binds exclusively to the S1 subunit of the spike protein",
            "It demonstrates limited cross-reactivity with other \u03b2 coronaviruses",
            "It is ineffective against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus"
        ],
        "Why is the S2 subunit considered a promising target for therapeutic interventions?": [
            "It is more conserved across various SARS-CoV-2 variants and other \u03b2 coronaviruses",
            "It has a higher mutation rate compared to the S1 subunit",
            "It directly binds to the host cell receptor, hACE2",
            "It is responsible for the initial attachment of the virus to host cells"
