            "By binding to conserved regions on the RBD.",
            "By enhancing the host's immune response.",
            "By degrading the viral RNA.",

        "What advantage do nanobodies have over traditional antibodies in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections?": [
            "They are smaller and can be directly administered to infection sites like the respiratory tract.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "They are more effective at crossing the blood-brain barrier.",
            "They can be produced without any microbial synthesis."

            "Differences in immune responses between animal models and humans.",
            "The inability to produce nanobodies in large quantities.",
            "The high cost of nanobody production.",

        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described in the summary?": [
            "It facilitates the virus's entry into host cells by interacting with the ACE2 receptor.",
            "It provides structural stability to the virus particle.",
            "It is responsible for the replication of the viral genome.",
            "It acts as an enzyme to degrade host cell membranes."
