            "They target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, preventing its interaction with the ACE2 receptor.",
            "They bind to the nucleocapsid protein, inhibiting viral replication.",
            "They block the viral RNA polymerase, stopping viral genome replication.",

        "What is a characteristic of VNAR antibodies derived from sharks in relation to SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "They target the S1 domain of the spike protein and are effective against mutations like E484K and N501Y.",
            "They bind to the nucleocapsid protein and prevent viral assembly.",

            "Their small size allows them to access epitopes that are inaccessible to conventional monoclonal antibodies.",
            "They have a higher binding affinity due to their single-domain structure.",
            "They can be produced more quickly than conventional monoclonal antibodies.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies."

            "To reduce immunogenicity while retaining antigen-binding specificity.",
            "To increase their binding affinity to human antigens.",
            "To enhance their stability in human serum.",
