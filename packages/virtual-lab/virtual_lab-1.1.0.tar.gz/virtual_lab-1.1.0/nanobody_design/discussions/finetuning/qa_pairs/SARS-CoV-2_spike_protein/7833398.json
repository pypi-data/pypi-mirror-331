            "Their smaller size allows them to access cryptic or recessed epitopes.",
            "Their larger size allows them to bind more strongly to the spike protein.",
            "Their ability to form dimers increases their binding affinity.",
            "Their glycosylation patterns enhance their binding to the spike protein."
