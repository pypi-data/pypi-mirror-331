        "How do nanobodies Nb14 and Nb9 neutralize MERS-CoV according to the study?": [
            "Nb14 disrupts the interaction with the hDPP4 receptor's glycan moiety, and Nb9 induces conformational changes in the RBD",
            "Nb14 blocks the main receptor-binding site, and Nb9 enhances the immune response",
            "Nb14 binds to the S2 subunit, and Nb9 prevents membrane fusion",
            "Nb14 and Nb9 both directly block the receptor-binding site"

        "What are the key characteristics of nanobodies that make them suitable for antiviral therapies against coronaviruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Small size, stability, specificity, high affinity, and low immunogenicity",
            "Large size, high immunogenicity, low stability, and moderate affinity",
            "Small size, low specificity, high immunogenicity, and low affinity",
            "High stability, large size, low specificity, and high immunogenicity"

        "What does the study suggest about the use of synergistic combinations of nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Combining nanobodies targeting different regions of the spike protein might improve therapeutic efficacy and prevent resistance",
            "Using a single nanobody is sufficient for complete neutralization of the virus",
            "Synergistic combinations are only effective against MERS-CoV, not SARS-CoV-2",
            "Combining nanobodies leads to increased immunogenicity and reduced efficacy"
        ],
        "What is the significance of targeting conserved regions across different coronaviruses, as highlighted in the study?": [
            "It suggests that nanobodies like Nb14 could potentially cross-neutralize multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2",
            "It indicates that only MERS-CoV can be effectively neutralized by these nanobodies",
            "It implies that each coronavirus requires a completely unique set of nanobodies",
            "It shows that conserved regions are not important for nanobody design"
        ],
        "What potential strategy for designing SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies is suggested by the identification of novel epitopes on the MERS-CoV RBD?": [
            "Targeting less accessible or conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "Focusing exclusively on the main receptor-binding site of the spike protein",
