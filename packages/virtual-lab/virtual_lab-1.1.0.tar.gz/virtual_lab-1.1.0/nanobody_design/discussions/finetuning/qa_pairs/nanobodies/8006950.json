        "How can nanobodies contribute to neutralizing SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "By binding to the spike protein and preventing its interaction with the ACE2 receptor.",
            "By binding to the ACE2 receptor and enhancing viral entry into host cells.",
            "By binding to the viral RNA and preventing its replication.",
            "By binding to the nucleocapsid protein and facilitating viral assembly."
        ],
        "How can nanobodies provide cross-reactivity against different SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "By targeting conserved regions of the spike protein.",
            "By specifically targeting the nucleocapsid protein.",
            "By binding exclusively to variant-specific epitopes.",
            "By targeting only the non-conserved regions of the spike protein."

        "What are nanobodies, and what is their origin?": [
            "Nanobodies are single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelid antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies are large, multi-domain antibodies derived from human antibodies.",
            "Nanobodies are synthetic peptides designed to mimic antibody function.",
            "Nanobodies are double-domain antibody fragments derived from rodent antibodies."
        ],
        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies in targeting SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "Nanobodies can access and bind to unique epitopes on the spike protein, potentially blocking the virus's ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor.",
            "Nanobodies can only bind to the nucleocapsid protein, limiting their effectiveness against the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies are too large to access the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein.",
            "Nanobodies are unable to bind to the spike protein due to their lack of specificity."
        ],
        "What makes nanobodies attractive for large-scale manufacturing and distribution?": [
            "Their stability and ease of production.",
            "Their requirement for complex production processes.",
            "Their instability and high production costs.",
            "Their dependence on rare raw materials for production."
