        "How are nanobodies typically produced for therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "By immunizing camelids with specific antigens, isolating B cells, amplifying antibody genes, and expressing them in host cells like E. coli.",
            "By synthesizing them chemically in vitro using peptide synthesis techniques.",
            "By extracting them directly from the blood of infected individuals and purifying them.",
            "By cloning human antibody genes into viral vectors and expressing them in mammalian cells."
        ],
        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies in terms of their molecular weight?": [
            "Their small molecular weight (<15 kDa) allows them to access epitopes inaccessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "Their large molecular weight (>150 kDa) enhances their binding affinity to viral antigens.",
            "Their moderate molecular weight (50-75 kDa) provides a balance between stability and specificity.",
            "Their variable molecular weight allows them to adapt to different antigenic structures."
        ],
        "What is a potential risk associated with the use of nanobodies that requires careful design and testing?": [
            "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)",
            "High immunogenicity in humans",
            "Rapid degradation in the bloodstream",
            "Limited production scalability"
        ],
        "What is a specific therapeutic application of nanobodies in treating COVID-19?": [
            "They can be administered via inhalation, allowing direct delivery to the lungs.",
            "They can be injected intravenously to provide systemic immune protection.",
            "They can be applied topically to mucosal surfaces to prevent viral entry.",
            "They can be ingested orally to enhance gut immunity against the virus."

        "Which nanobody demonstrated the ability to stabilize RBDs in the down state, preventing ACE2 binding?": [
