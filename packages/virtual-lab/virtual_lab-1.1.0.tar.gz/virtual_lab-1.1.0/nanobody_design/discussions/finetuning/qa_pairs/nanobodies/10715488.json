        "What is the primary target of the VNARs isolated from nurse sharks in the study?": [
            "The S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
            "The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2",
            "The membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2"
        ],
        "What modification was made to S2A9 to enhance its neutralization potency in pseudovirus assays?": [
            "It was engineered into a bivalent human Fc format (S2A9-hFc)",
            "It was conjugated with a fluorescent marker",
            "It was fused with a camelid-derived VHH domain",
            "It was linked to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule"
        ],
        "What potential advantage do VNARs have over conventional antibodies according to the study?": [
            "Their ability to access deep antigenic pockets and form disulfide bonds",
            "Their larger size allows for more robust binding",
            "They can be easily produced in bacterial systems",
            "They have a higher mutation rate leading to rapid evolution"
        ],
        "What was a notable characteristic of the S2A9 VNAR despite its broad neutralization capability?": [
            "It exhibited relatively weak binding characteristics compared to other VNARs",
            "It showed high binding affinity but limited neutralization",
            "It was unable to bind to any SARS-CoV-2 variants",
            "It demonstrated strong binding but only to the alpha variant"
        ],
        "Which VNAR demonstrated the best neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "S2A9",

            "N3C5",
