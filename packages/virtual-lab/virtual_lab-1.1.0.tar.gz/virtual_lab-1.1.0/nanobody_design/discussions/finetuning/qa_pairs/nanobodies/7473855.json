        "What is a key advantage of nanobodies like Ty1 over conventional antibodies in therapeutic applications?": [
            "Their smaller size allows for easier cloning, expression, and manipulation.",
            "They have a longer serum half-life than conventional antibodies.",
            "They can be produced in mammalian cells at higher yields.",
