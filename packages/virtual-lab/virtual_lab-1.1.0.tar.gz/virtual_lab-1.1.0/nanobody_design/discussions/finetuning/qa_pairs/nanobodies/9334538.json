            "The synergy between aRBD-2 and the other nanobodies facilitates interactions with non-mutated residues.",
            "The individual nanobodies have inherently high binding affinities on their own.",
            "The nanobodies are able to bind to the spike protein's fusion peptide.",
            "The nanobodies are engineered to bind to the same epitope, increasing overall binding strength."

        "What is the primary advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies as mentioned in the study?": [
            "They are smaller, more stable, easier to produce, and can be engineered into multivalent forms.",
            "They have a higher molecular weight, which enhances their stability.",
            "They are derived from human antibodies, making them less likely to cause immune reactions.",

            "An epitope located on the N-terminal domain of the spike protein.",
