        "How can nanobodies be engineered to maintain efficacy against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants?": [
            "By designing them to bind to conserved regions of the spike protein for broad neutralization.",
            "By increasing their size to cover more surface area of the spike protein.",
            "By incorporating multiple binding sites for different viral proteins.",
            "By enhancing their ability to trigger host immune responses."
        ],
        "What advantage do nanobodies have over conventional antibodies in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Their small size allows them to access epitopes that are less accessible to conventional antibodies.",
            "They are more cost-effective to produce than conventional antibodies.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream compared to conventional antibodies.",
            "They can be administered orally, unlike conventional antibodies."
        ],
        "What is a potential delivery method for nanobodies that is particularly relevant for respiratory viruses?": [
            "Inhalation, to enhance local concentrations in the respiratory tract.",
            "Intravenous injection, to ensure rapid systemic distribution.",
            "Oral administration, to facilitate easy patient compliance.",
            "Topical application, to directly target the site of infection."
        ],
        "What is the primary role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the viral life cycle?": [
            "Facilitating the binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells, initiating the fusion process necessary for viral entry.",
            "Providing structural integrity to the viral particle.",
            "Inhibiting host immune responses to allow viral replication.",
            "Transporting viral RNA into the host cell nucleus."
        ],
        "Why is the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein a primary target for therapeutic interventions?": [
            "Because it plays an essential role in viral entry, making it a critical point for blocking infection.",
            "Because it is the most abundant protein on the virus surface.",
            "Because it is responsible for the replication of viral RNA.",
            "Because it is the least variable protein among different coronavirus strains."
