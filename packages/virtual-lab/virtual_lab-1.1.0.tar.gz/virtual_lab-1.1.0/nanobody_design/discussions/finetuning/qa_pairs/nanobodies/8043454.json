        "How were the nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein generated?": [
            "Two llamas were immunized with Spike subunits (S1 and S2) to generate a diverse repertoire.",
            "Mice were genetically engineered to produce human-like nanobodies targeting the Spike protein.",
            "Human volunteers were vaccinated with Spike protein to elicit nanobody production.",
            "Nanobodies were synthesized in vitro using phage display technology."
        ],
        "What are the origins of nanobodies as described in the study?": [
            "Derived from the variable domain (VHH) of heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids.",
            "Synthesized artificially in laboratories using recombinant DNA technology.",
            "Produced by genetically modified bacteria engineered to express VHH domains.",
            "Isolated from the immune systems of marine mammals such as dolphins and whales."
        ],
        "What method was used to determine the binding affinity of the nanobodies?": [
            "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine kinetic properties and affinities.",
            "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure binding strength.",
            "Flow cytometry was employed to assess nanobody binding to Spike protein.",
            "Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate nanobody interactions."
        ],
        "What percentage of the nanobody repertoire showed potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus?": [
            "Approximately 40% of the nanobody repertoire showed potent neutralization.",
            "Around 25% of the nanobody repertoire demonstrated strong neutralization.",
            "Nearly 60% of the nanobody repertoire exhibited potent neutralization.",
            "About 75% of the nanobody repertoire was effective in neutralization."
        ],
        "What potential delivery method is highlighted for nanobodies due to their small size and stability?": [
            "Nebulization, providing high local concentrations in the respiratory tract.",
            "Intravenous injection, allowing systemic distribution throughout the body.",
            "Oral administration, enabling easy and non-invasive delivery.",
            "Topical application, targeting localized skin infections."
