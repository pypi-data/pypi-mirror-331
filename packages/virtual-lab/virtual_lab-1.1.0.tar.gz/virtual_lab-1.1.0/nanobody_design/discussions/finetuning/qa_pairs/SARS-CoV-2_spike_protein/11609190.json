        "How do multivalent nanobodies enhance neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2?": [
            "By targeting multiple epitopes simultaneously.",
            "By increasing the binding affinity to a single epitope.",
            "By reducing the size of the nanobody for better penetration.",
            "By altering the spike protein to prevent mutation."
        ],
        "What challenge does the continuous mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pose for antibody development?": [
            "It requires ongoing adaptation of antibody designs to account for potential future mutations.",
            "It leads to increased production costs for antibody therapies.",
            "It necessitates the use of higher doses of antibodies for effectiveness.",
            "It causes antibodies to become toxic to human cells."

        "What is a significant advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?": [
            "Their small size allows them to access hidden epitopes on the spike protein.",
            "They have a longer half-life in the bloodstream.",
            "They are less expensive to produce.",
            "They can be administered orally."
        ],
        "What is the primary function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in viral entry?": [
            "It binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells, facilitating viral entry.",
            "It directly fuses the viral membrane with the host cell membrane.",
            "It acts as a protease to cleave host cell proteins.",
            "It serves as a decoy to distract the host immune system."
