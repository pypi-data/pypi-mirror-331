Title = Efficient consideration of coordinated water molecules improves computational protein-protein and protein-ligand docking discrimination

Highly coordinated water molecules are frequently an integral part of protein-protein and protein-ligand interfaces. We introduce an updated energy model that efficiently captures the energetic effects of these ordered water molecules on the surfaces of proteins. A two-stage method is developed in which polar groups arranged in geometries suitable for water placement are first identified, then a modified Monte Carlo simulation allows highly coordinated waters to be placed on the surface of a protein while simultaneously sampling amino acid side chain orientations. This “semi-explicit” water model is implemented in Rosetta and is suitable for both structure prediction and protein design. We show that our new approach and energy model yield significant improvements in native structure recovery of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking discrimination tests.

Well-coordinated water molecules—those forming multiple hydrogen bonds with nearby polar groups—play an important role in the structure of biomolecular systems, yet the effect of these waters is often not considered in molecular energy computations. In this paper, we describe a method to efficiently consider these water molecules both implicitly and explicitly at the interfaces formed by two polar molecules. In computations related to determining how a protein interacts with binding partners, we show that the use of this new method significantly improves results. Future application of this approach may improve the design of new protein and small molecule drugs.

Title = Rosetta:MSF:NN: Boosting performance of multi-state computational protein design with a neural network

Rational protein design aims at the targeted modification of existing proteins. To reach this goal, software suites like Rosetta propose sequences to introduce the desired properties. Challenging design problems necessitate the representation of a protein by means of a structural ensemble. Thus, Rosetta multi-state design (MSD) protocols have been developed wherein each state represents one protein conformation. Computational demands of MSD protocols are high, because for each of the candidate sequences a costly three-dimensional (3D) model has to be created and assessed for all states. Each of these scores contributes one data point to a complex, design-specific energy landscape. As neural networks (NN) proved well-suited to learn such solution spaces, we integrated one into the framework Rosetta:MSF instead of the so far used genetic algorithm with the aim to reduce computational costs. As its predecessor, Rosetta:MSF:NN administers a set of candidate sequences and their scores and scans sequence space iteratively. During each iteration, the union of all candidate sequences and their Rosetta scores are used to re-train NNs that possess a design-specific architecture. The enormous speed of the NNs allows an extensive assessment of alternative sequences, which are ranked on the scores predicted by the NN. Costly 3D models are computed only for a small fraction of best-scoring sequences; these and the corresponding 3D-based scores replace half of the candidate sequences during each iteration. The analysis of two sets of candidate sequences generated for a specific design problem by means of a genetic algorithm confirmed that the NN predicted 3D-based scores quite well; the Pearson correlation coefficient was at least 0.95. Applying Rosetta:MSF:NN:enzdes to a benchmark consisting of 16 ligand-binding problems showed that this protocol converges ten-times faster than the genetic algorithm and finds sequences with comparable scores.

Title = Combining Rosetta Sequence Design with Protein Language Model Predictions Using Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) as Restraint

Computational protein sequence design has the ambitious goal of modifying existing or creating new proteins; however, designing stable and functional proteins is challenging without predictability of protein dynamics and allostery. Informing protein design methods with evolutionary information limits the mutational space to more native-like sequences and results in increased stability while maintaining functions. Recently, language models, trained on millions of protein sequences, have shown impressive performance in predicting the effects of mutations. Assessing Rosetta-designed sequences with a language model showed scores that were worse than those of their original sequence. To inform Rosetta design protocols with language model predictions, we added a new metric to restrain the energy function during design using the Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) model. The resulting sequences have better language model scores and similar sequence recovery, with only a minor decrease in the fitness as assessed by Rosetta energy. In conclusion, our work combines the strength of recent machine learning approaches with the Rosetta protein design toolbox.

Title = Modeling Immunity with Rosetta: Methods for Antibody and Antigen Design

Structure-based antibody and antigen design has advanced greatly in recent years, due not only to the increasing availability of experimentally determined structures but also to improved computational methods for both prediction and design. Constant improvements in performance within the Rosetta software suite for biomolecular modeling have given rise to a greater breadth of structure prediction, including docking and design application cases for antibody and antigen modeling. Here, we present an overview of current protocols for antibody and antigen modeling using Rosetta and exemplify those by detailed tutorials originally developed for a Rosetta workshop at Vanderbilt University. These tutorials cover antibody structure prediction, docking, and design and antigen design strategies, including the addition of glycans in Rosetta. We expect that these materials will allow novice users to apply Rosetta in their own projects for modeling antibodies and antigens.

Title = De novo design of small beta barrel proteins

De novo design of mini-proteins for engineering new functions has primarily focused on all-alpha and alpha-beta folds. Despite the enormous functional diversity observed in naturally occurring beta barrels less than 70 residues in length, the de novo design of these structures has not been achieved. Here, we describe the de novo design and characterization of four different classes of small beta barrels. The results provide insight into the determinants of folding and design of this important class of proteins, and provide routes to the design of high-affinity binding proteins.

Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy–based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 Å rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.

Title = Perturbing the energy landscape for improved packing during computational protein design

The FastDesign protocol in the molecular modeling program Rosetta iterates between sequence optimization and structure refinement to stabilize de novo designed protein structures and complexes. FastDesign has been used previously to design novel protein folds and assemblies with important applications in research and medicine. To promote sampling of alternative conformations and sequences, FastDesign includes stages where the energy landscape is smoothened by reducing repulsive forces. Here, we discover that this process disfavors larger amino acids in the protein core because the protein compresses in the early stages of refinement. By testing alternative ramping strategies for the repulsive weight, we arrive at a scheme that produces lower energy designs with more native-like sequence composition in the protein core. We further validate the protocol by designing and experimentally characterizing over 4000 proteins and show that the new protocol produces higher stability proteins.

Title = Rosetta FunFolDes – A general framework for the computational design of functional proteins

The robust computational design of functional proteins has the potential to deeply impact translational research and broaden our understanding of the determinants of protein function and stability. The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one de novo “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.

The ability to use computational tools to manipulate the structure and function of proteins has the potential to impact many facets of fundamental and translational science. Due to our limited understanding of the principles that govern protein function and structure, the computational design of functional proteins remains challenging. We developed a computational protocol (Rosetta FunFolDes) to facilitate the insertion of functional motifs into heterologous proteins. We performed extensive in silico benchmarks, and found that when the design of function is required the global energy minima may not be the optimal solution, in line with previously reported experimental studies. Further, we used FunFolDes to design two novel functional proteins, displaying two viral epitopes that can be of interest for vaccine development. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized, showing that functionalization was successfully achieved. These results highlight the capability of FunFolDes to address common challenges on the design of functional proteins. In particular, the reduced structural compatibility between functional sites and host scaffolds, effectively enabling the repurposing of old protein folds for new functions. Overall, FunFolDes provides new means to accomplish the challenging task of functionalizing computationally designed proteins.

Title = Combining machine learning with structure-based protein design to predict and engineer post-translational modifications of proteins

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play a vital role in their function and stability. These modifications influence protein folding, signaling, protein-protein interactions, enzyme activity, binding affinity, aggregation, degradation, and much more. To date, over 400 types of PTMs have been described, representing chemical diversity well beyond the genetically encoded amino acids. Such modifications pose a challenge to the successful design of proteins, but also represent a major opportunity to diversify the protein engineering toolbox. To this end, we first trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict eighteen of the most abundant PTMs, including protein glycosylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and deamidation. In a second step, these models were implemented inside the computational protein modeling suite Rosetta, which allows flexible combination with existing protocols to model the modified sites and understand their impact on protein stability as well as function. Lastly, we developed a new design protocol that either maximizes or minimizes the predicted probability of a particular site being modified. We find that this combination of ANN prediction and structure-based design can enable the modification of existing, as well as the introduction of novel, PTMs. The potential applications of our work include, but are not limited to, glycan masking of epitopes, strengthening protein-protein interactions through phosphorylation, as well as protecting proteins from deamidation liabilities. These applications are especially important for the design of new protein therapeutics where PTMs can drastically change the therapeutic properties of a protein. Our work adds novel tools to Rosetta’s protein engineering toolbox that allow for the rational design of PTMs.

Machine learning is changing the world of protein design, from structure prediction methods like AlphaFold to fixed-backbone design methods like ProteinMPNN. machine learning methods have made much progress in various aspects of protein computational biology, both complementing and, in some cases, surpassing traditional macromolecular modeling methods such as those combined in libraries like the Rosetta software suite. However, a lack of compatibility and flexibility can hinder interoperability with existing methods, preventing the full potential of these new solutions from being realized. Here, we first present a new machine learning tool for predicting post-translational modifications (PTMs), which play an important role in the stability and function of proteins, and then highlight how the implementation of this tool in the existing Rosetta toolbox can facilitate new applications. To this end, we combine PTM prediction with protein design, maximizing or minimizing the predicted probability of a post-translational modification occurring at a specific site. As one example, we predict the N-linked glycosylation of influenza hemagglutinin, which has applications in both understanding the evolution of viral strains over time, and engineering additional glycosylation sites to mask unwanted epitopes of vaccine candidates.

Title = Rosetta design with co-evolutionary information retains protein function

Computational protein design has the ambitious goal of crafting novel proteins that address challenges in biology and medicine. To overcome these challenges, the computational protein modeling suite Rosetta has been tailored to address various protein design tasks. Recently, statistical methods have been developed that identify correlated mutations between residues in a multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins. These subtle inter-dependencies in the occupancy of residue positions throughout evolution are crucial for protein function, but we found that three current Rosetta design approaches fail to recover these co-evolutionary couplings. Thus, we developed the Rosetta method ResCue (residue-coupling enhanced) that leverages co-evolutionary information to favor sequences which recapitulate correlated mutations, as observed in nature. To assess the protocols via recapitulation designs, we compiled a benchmark of ten proteins each represented by two, structurally diverse states. We could demonstrate that ResCue designed sequences with an average sequence recovery rate of 70%, whereas three other protocols reached not more than 50%, on average. Our approach had higher recovery rates also for functionally important residues, which were studied in detail. This improvement has only a minor negative effect on the fitness of the designed sequences as assessed by Rosetta energy. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that informing protocols with co-evolutionary signals helps to design stable and native-like proteins that are compatible with the different conformational states required for a complex function.

In homologous proteins, functionally or structurally important residues are strongly conserved. Thus, the consideration of conservation signals during protein design protocols can help to create sequences that are more native-like. However, the number of conserved residues is small in many proteins and not all important residues can be captured by conservation analysis. Residues are forming networks whose composition is dictated by protein structure function and thus is visible through the co-evolutionary analysis. Nowadays, advanced methods allow us to deduce these networks from multiple sequence alignments. Thus, we have implemented the novel Rosetta method termed ‘ResCue’ that informs the design protocol with co-evolutionary signals. Recapitulation designs based on ten difficult benchmarks made clear that this protocol creates sequences that are more native-like than three other, state-of-the-art design protocols.

Title = Rapid and automated design of two-component protein nanomaterials using ProteinMPNN

We address the current limitations in design of protein–protein interfaces by employing ProteinMPNN, a deep learning method, to create tetrahedral two-component protein nanomaterials that outperform the established physics-based Rosetta design method in terms of computational efficiency and manual refinement. Importantly, the interfaces designed by ProteinMPNN exhibit enhanced polarity, facilitating the seamless assembly of nanomaterials in vitro, which is crucial for efficient biotechnological manufacturing. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning in democratizing protein interface design and showcases the potential of advanced AI methods in speeding up the development of the next generation of protein-based technologies.

The design of protein–protein interfaces using physics-based design methods such as Rosetta requires substantial computational resources and manual refinement by expert structural biologists. Deep learning methods promise to simplify protein–protein interface design and enable its application to a wide variety of problems by researchers from various scientific disciplines. Here, we test the ability of a deep learning method for protein sequence design, ProteinMPNN, to design two-component tetrahedral protein nanomaterials and benchmark its performance against Rosetta. ProteinMPNN had a similar success rate to Rosetta, yielding 13 new experimentally confirmed assemblies, but required orders of magnitude less computation and no manual refinement. The interfaces designed by ProteinMPNN were substantially more polar than those designed by Rosetta, which facilitated in vitro assembly of the designed nanomaterials from independently purified components. Crystal structures of several of the assemblies confirmed the accuracy of the design method at high resolution. Our results showcase the potential of deep learning–based methods to unlock the widespread application of designed protein–protein interfaces and self-assembling protein nanomaterials in biotechnology.

Title = Protein structure prediction using sparse NOE and RDC restraints with Rosetta in CASP13

Computational methods that produce accurate protein structure models from limited experimental data, e.g. from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, hold great potential for biomedical research. The NMR-assisted modeling challenge in CASP13 provided a blind test to explore the capabilities and limitations of current modeling techniques in leveraging NMR data which had high sparsity, ambiguity and error rate for protein structure prediction. We describe our approach to predict the structure of these proteins leveraging the Rosetta software suite. Protein structure models were predicted de novo using a two-stage protocol. First, low-resolution models were generated with the Rosetta de novo method guided by non-ambiguous nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) contacts and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints. Second, iterative model hybridization and fragment insertion with the Rosetta comparative modeling method was used to refine and regularize models guided by all ambiguous and non-ambiguous NOE contacts and RDCs. Nine out of 16 of the Rosetta de novo models had the correct fold (GDT-TS score >45) and in three cases high-resolution models were achieved (RMSD <3.5 Å). We also show that a meta-approach applying iterative Rosetta+NMR refinement on server-predicted models which employed non-NMR-contacts and structural templates leads to substantial improvement in model quality. Integrating these data-assisted refinement strategies with innovative non-data-assisted approaches which became possible in CASP13 such as high precision contact prediction will in the near future enable structure determination for large proteins that are outside of the realm of conventional NMR.

Title = Accurate protein structure prediction with hydroxyl radical protein footprinting data

Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) in combination with mass spectrometry reveals the relative solvent exposure of labeled residues within a protein, thereby providing insight into protein tertiary structure. HRPF labels nineteen residues with varying degrees of reliability and reactivity. Here, we are presenting a dynamics-driven HRPF-guided algorithm for protein structure prediction. In a benchmark test of our algorithm, usage of the dynamics data in a score term resulted in notable improvement of the root-mean-square deviations of the lowest-scoring ab initio models and improved the funnel-like metric Pnear for all benchmark proteins. We identified models with accurate atomic detail for three of the four benchmark proteins. This work suggests that HRPF data along with side chain dynamics sampled by a Rosetta mover ensemble can be used to accurately predict protein structure.

Mass spectrometry-based covalent labeling techniques such as hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) provide information about protein tertiary structures. Here, the authors present a dynamics driven HRPF-guided algorithm for protein structure prediction that is incorporated in the Rosetta software suite and only requires the protein sequence and HRPF data as input and they demonstrate its successful application to four benchmark proteins.

Title = Utility of Covalent Labeling Mass Spectrometry Data in Protein Structure Prediction with Rosetta

Covalent labeling mass spectrometry experiments are growing in popularity and provide important information regarding protein structure. Information obtained from these experiments correlates with residue solvent exposure within the protein in solution. However, it is impossible to determine protein structure from covalent labeling data alone. Incorporation of sparse covalent labeling data into the protein structure prediction software Rosetta has been shown to improve protein tertiary structure prediction. Here, covalent labeling techniques were analyzed computationally to provide insight into what labeling data is needed to optimize tertiary protein structure prediction in Rosetta. We have successfully implemented a new scoring functionality that provides improved predictions. We developed two new covalent labeling based score terms that use a “cone”-based neighbor count to quantify the relative solvent exposure of each amino acid. To test our method, we used a set of 20 proteins with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Decoy model sets were generated for each of these 20 proteins and the normalized covalent labeling score versus RMSD distributions were evaluated. Based on these distributions, we have determined an optimal subset of residues to use when performing covalent labeling experiments in order to maximize the structure prediction capabilities of the covalent labeling data. We also investigated how much false negative and false positive data can be tolerated without meaningfully impacting protein structure prediction. Using these new covalent labeling score terms, protein models were rescored and the resulting models improved by 3.9 Å RMSD on average. New models were also generated using Rosetta’s AbinitioRelax program under the guidance of covalent labeling information and improvement in model quality was observed.

Title = The Rosetta all-atom energy function for macromolecular modeling and design

Over the past decade, the Rosetta biomolecular modeling suite has informed diverse biological questions and engineering challenges ranging from interpretation of low-resolution structural data to design of nanomaterials, protein therapeutics, and vaccines. Central to Rosetta’s success is the energy function: a model parameterized from small molecule and X-ray crystal structure data used to approximate the energy associated with each biomolecule conformation. This paper describes the mathematical models and physical concepts that underlie the latest Rosetta Energy Function, REF15. Applying these concepts, we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models. Finally, we discuss the latest advances in the energy function that extend capabilities from soluble proteins to also include membrane proteins, peptides containing non-canonical amino acids, small molecules, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules.

Title = Assessing multiple score functions in Rosetta for drug discovery

Rosetta is a computational software suite containing algorithms for a wide variety of macromolecular structure prediction and design tasks including small molecule protocols commonly used in drug discovery or enzyme design. Here, we benchmark RosettaLigand score functions and protocols in comparison to results of other software recently published in the Comparative Assessment of Score Functions (CASF-2016). The CASF-2016 benchmark covers a wide variety of tests including scoring and ranking multiple compounds against a target, ligand docking of a small molecule to a target, and virtual screening to extract binders from a compound library. Direct comparison to the score functions provided by CASF-2016 results shows that the original RosettaLigand score function ranks among the top software for scoring, ranking, docking and screening tests. Most notably, the RosettaLigand score function ranked 2/34 among other report score functions in CASF-2016. We additionally perform a ligand docking test with full sampling to mimic typical use cases. Despite improved performance of newer score functions in canonical protein structure prediction and design, we demonstrate here that more recent Rosetta score functions have reduced performance across all small molecule benchmarks. The tests described here have also been uploaded to the Rosetta scientific benchmarking server and will be run weekly to track performance as the code is continually being developed.

Title = Comparison of Rosetta flexible-backbone computational protein design methods on binding interactions

Computational design of binding sites in proteins remains difficult, in part due to limitations in our current ability to sample backbone conformations that enable precise and accurate geometric positioning of side chains during sequence design. Here we present a benchmark framework for comparison between flexible-backbone design methods applied to binding interactions. We quantify the ability of different flexible backbone design methods in the widely used protein design software Rosetta to recapitulate observed protein sequence profiles assumed to represent functional protein/protein and protein/small molecule binding interactions. The CoupledMoves method, which combines backbone flexibility and sequence exploration into a single acceptance step during the sampling trajectory, better recapitulates observed sequence profiles than the BackrubEnsemble and FastDesign methods, which separate backbone flexibility and sequence design into separate acceptance steps during the sampling trajectory. Flexible-backbone design with the CoupledMoves method is a powerful strategy for reducing sequence space to generate targeted libraries for experimental screening and selection.

Title = MHCEpitopeEnergy, a flexible Rosetta-based biotherapeutic deimmunization platform

As non-“self” macromolecules, biotherapeutics can trigger an immune response that can reduce drug efficacy, require patients to be taken off therapy, or even cause life-threatening reactions. To enable flexible and facile design of protein biotherapeutics while reducing the prevalence of T cell epitopes that drive immune recognition, we have integrated into the Rosetta protein design suite a new scoring term that allows design protocols to account for predicted or experimentally-identified epitopes in the optimized objective function. This flexible scoring term can be used in any Rosetta design trajectory, can be targeted to specific regions of a protein, and can be readily extended to work with a variety of epitope predictors. By performing extensive design runs with varied design parameter choices for three case study proteins as well as a larger diverse benchmark, we show that the incorporation of this scoring term enables effective exploration of an alternative, deimmunized sequence space to discover diverse proteins that are potentially highly deimmunized while retaining physical and chemical qualities similar to those yielded by equivalent non-deimmunizing sequence design protocols.

Title = Protein sequence design by conformational landscape optimization

Almost all proteins fold to their lowest free energy state, which is determined by their amino acid sequence. Computational protein design has primarily focused on finding sequences that have very low energy in the target designed structure. However, what is most relevant during folding is not the absolute energy of the folded state but the energy difference between the folded state and the lowest-lying alternative states. We describe a deep learning approach that captures aspects of the folding landscape, in particular the presence of structures in alternative energy minima, and show that it can enhance current protein design methods.

The protein design problem is to identify an amino acid sequence that folds to a desired structure. Given Anfinsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis of folding, this can be recast as finding an amino acid sequence for which the desired structure is the lowest energy state. As this calculation involves not only all possible amino acid sequences but also, all possible structures, most current approaches focus instead on the more tractable problem of finding the lowest-energy amino acid sequence for the desired structure, often checking by protein structure prediction in a second step that the desired structure is indeed the lowest-energy conformation for the designed sequence, and typically discarding a large fraction of designed sequences for which this is not the case. Here, we show that by backpropagating gradients through the transform-restrained Rosetta (trRosetta) structure prediction network from the desired structure to the input amino acid sequence, we can directly optimize over all possible amino acid sequences and all possible structures in a single calculation. We find that trRosetta calculations, which consider the full conformational landscape, can be more effective than Rosetta single-point energy estimations in predicting folding and stability of de novo designed proteins. We compare sequence design by conformational landscape optimization with the standard energy-based sequence design methodology in Rosetta and show that the former can result in energy landscapes with fewer alternative energy minima. We show further that more funneled energy landscapes can be designed by combining the strengths of the two approaches: the low-resolution trRosetta model serves to disfavor alternative states, and the high-resolution Rosetta model serves to create a deep energy minimum at the design target structure.

Chemical Shift-Rosetta (CS-Rosetta) is an automated method that employs NMR chemical shifts to model protein structures de novo.

We describe the architecture and functionality of automatic NOESY assignment (AutoNOE) and structure determination protocols (Abrelax and RASREC) within the CS-Rosetta framework. We further demonstrate how CS-Rosetta can discriminate near-native structures against a large conformational search space using restraints obtained from NMR data, and/or sequence and structure homology. We highlight how CS-Rosetta can be combined with alternative automated approaches to (i) model oligomeric systems and (ii) create NMR-based structure determination pipeline. To show its practical applicability, we emphasize on the computational requirements and performance of CS-Rosetta for protein targets of varying molecular weight and complexity. Finally, we discuss the current Python interface, which enables easy execution of protocols for rapid and accurate high-resolution structure determination.

Title = Protein shape sampled by ion mobility mass spectrometry consistently improves protein structure prediction

Ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry provides structural information about protein shape and size in the form of an orientationally-averaged collision cross-section (CCSIM). While IM data have been used with various computational methods, they have not yet been utilized to predict monomeric protein structure from sequence. Here, we show that IM data can significantly improve protein structure determination using the modelling suite Rosetta. We develop the Rosetta Projection Approximation using Rough Circular Shapes (PARCS) algorithm that allows for fast and accurate prediction of CCSIM from structure. Following successful testing of the PARCS algorithm, we use an integrative modelling approach to utilize IM data for protein structure prediction. Additionally, we propose a confidence metric that identifies near native models in the absence of a known structure. The results of this study demonstrate the ability of IM data to consistently improve protein structure prediction.

Collision cross sections (CCS) from ion mobility mass spectrometry provide information about protein shape and size. Here, the authors develop an algorithm to predict CCS and integrate experimental ion mobility data into Rosetta-based molecular modelling to predict protein structures from sequence.

Title = Real-Time PyMOL Visualization for Rosetta and PyRosetta

Computational structure prediction and design of proteins and protein-protein complexes have long been inaccessible to those not directly involved in the field. A key missing component has been the ability to visualize the progress of calculations to better understand them. Rosetta is one simulation suite that would benefit from a robust real-time visualization solution. Several tools exist for the sole purpose of visualizing biomolecules; one of the most popular tools, PyMOL (Schrödinger), is a powerful, highly extensible, user friendly, and attractive package. Integrating Rosetta and PyMOL directly has many technical and logistical obstacles inhibiting usage. To circumvent these issues, we developed a novel solution based on transmitting biomolecular structure and energy information via UDP sockets. Rosetta and PyMOL run as separate processes, thereby avoiding many technical obstacles while visualizing information on-demand in real-time. When Rosetta detects changes in the structure of a protein, new coordinates are sent over a UDP network socket to a PyMOL instance running a UDP socket listener. PyMOL then interprets and displays the molecule. This implementation also allows remote execution of Rosetta. When combined with PyRosetta, this visualization solution provides an interactive environment for protein structure prediction and design.

Title = Protein structure prediction using Rosetta in CASP12

We describe several notable aspects of our structure predictions using Rosetta in CASP12 in the free modeling (FM) and refinement (TR) categories. First, we had previously generated (and published) models for most large protein families lacking experimentally determined structures using Rosetta guided by co-evolution based contact predictions, and for several targets these models proved better starting points for comparative modeling than any known crystal structure—our model database thus starts to fulfill one of the goals of the original protein structure initiative. Second, while our “human” group simply submitted ROBETTA models for most targets, for six targets expert intervention improved predictions considerably; the largest improvement was for T0886 where we correctly parsed two discontinuous domains guided by predicted contact maps to accurately identify a structural homolog of the same fold. Third, Rosetta all atom refinement followed by MD simulations led to consistent but small improvements when starting models were close to the native structure, and larger but less consistent improvements when starting models were further away.

Title = Recent Advances in NMR Protein Structure Prediction with ROSETTA

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for studying the structure and dynamics of proteins in their native state. For high-resolution NMR structure determination, the collection of a rich restraint dataset is necessary. This can be difficult to achieve for proteins with high molecular weight or a complex architecture. Computational modeling techniques can complement sparse NMR datasets (<1 restraint per residue) with additional structural information to elucidate protein structures in these difficult cases. The Rosetta software for protein structure modeling and design is used by structural biologists for structure determination tasks in which limited experimental data is available. This review gives an overview of the computational protocols available in the Rosetta framework for modeling protein structures from NMR data. We explain the computational algorithms used for the integration of different NMR data types in Rosetta. We also highlight new developments, including modeling tools for data from paramagnetic NMR and hydrogen–deuterium exchange, as well as chemical shifts in CS-Rosetta. Furthermore, strategies are discussed to complement and improve structure predictions made by the current state-of-the-art AlphaFold2 program using NMR-guided Rosetta modeling.

Title = Modeling beta-sheet peptide-protein interactions: Rosetta FlexPepDock in CAPRI rounds 38-45

Peptide-protein docking is challenging due to the considerable conformational freedom of the peptide. CAPRI rounds 38-45 included two peptide-protein interactions, both characterized by a peptide forming an additional beta strand of a beta sheet in the receptor. Using the Rosetta FlexPepDock peptide docking protocol we generated top-performing, high-accuracy models for targets 134 and 135, involving an interaction between a peptide derived from L-MAG with DLC8. In addition, we were able to generate the only medium-accuracy models for a particularly challenging target, T121. In contrast to the classical peptide-mediated interaction, in which receptor side chains contact both peptide backbone and side chains, beta-sheet complementation involves a major contribution to binding by hydrogen bonds between main chain atoms. To establish how binding affinity and specificity are established in this special class of peptide-protein interactions, we extracted PeptiDBeta, a benchmark of solved structures of different protein domains that are bound by peptides via beta-sheet complementation, and tested our protocol for global peptide-docking PIPER-FlexPepDock on this dataset. We find that the beta-strand part of the peptide is sufficient to generate approximate and even high resolution models of many interactions, but inclusion of adjacent motif residues often provides additional information necessary to achieve high resolution model quality.

Title = Novel sampling strategies and a coarse-grained score function for docking homomers, flexible heteromers, and oligosaccharides using Rosetta in CAPRI rounds 37–45

Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions (CAPRI) rounds 37 through 45 introduced larger complexes, new macromolecules, and multistage assemblies. For these rounds, we used and expanded docking methods in Rosetta to model 23 target complexes. We successfully predicted 14 target complexes and recognized and refined near-native models generated by other groups for two further targets. Notably, for targets T110 and T136, we achieved the closest prediction of any CAPRI participant. We created several innovative approaches during these rounds. Since round 39 (target 122), we have used the new RosettaDock 4.0, which has a revamped coarse-grained energy function and the ability to perform conformer selection during docking with hundreds of pregenerated protein backbones. Ten of the complexes had some degree of symmetry in their interactions, so we tested Rosetta SymDock, realized its shortcomings, and developed the next-generation symmetric docking protocol, SymDock2, which includes docking of multiple backbones and induced-fit refinement. Since the last CAPRI assessment, we also developed methods for modeling and designing carbohydrates in Rosetta, and we used them to successfully model oligosaccharide-protein complexes in round 41. Although the results were broadly encouraging, they also highlighted the pressing need to invest in (a) flexible docking algorithms with the ability to model loop and linker motions and in (b) new sampling and scoring methods for oligosaccharide-protein interactions.

Title = Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta

The use of unnatural fluorogenic molecules widely expands the pallet of available genetically encoded fluorescent imaging tools through the design of fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs). While there is already a handful of such probes available, each of them went through laborious cycles of in vitro screening and selection. Computational modeling approaches are evolving incredibly fast right now and are demonstrating great results in many applications, including de novo protein design. It suggests that the easier task of fine-tuning the fluorogen-binding properties of an already functional protein in silico should be readily achievable. To test this hypothesis, we used Rosetta for computational ligand docking followed by protein binding pocket redesign to further improve the previously described FAP DiB1 that is capable of binding to a BODIPY-like dye M739. Despite an inaccurate initial docking of the chromophore, the incorporated mutations nevertheless improved multiple photophysical parameters as well as the overall performance of the tag. The designed protein, DiB-RM, shows higher brightness, localization precision, and apparent photostability in protein-PAINT super-resolution imaging compared to its parental variant DiB1. Moreover, DiB-RM can be cleaved to obtain an efficient split system with enhanced performance compared to a parental DiB-split system. The possible reasons for the inaccurate ligand binding pose prediction and its consequence on the outcome of the design experiment are further discussed.

Computational approaches have recently made significant progress in the protein engineering field evolving from a tool for helping experimentalists to prioritize or short-list mutations for testing to being capable of making fully reliable predictions. However, not all the fields of protein modeling are evolving at a similar pace. That is why evaluating the capabilities of computational tools on different tasks is important to provide other scientists with up-to-date information on the state of the field. Here we tested the performance of Rosetta (one of the leading macromolecule modeling tools) in improving small molecule-binding proteins. We successfully redesigned a fluorogen binding protein DiB1 –a protein that binds a non-fluorescent molecule and enforces its fluorescence in the obtained complex–for improved brightness and better performance in super-resolution imaging. Our results suggest that such tasks can be already achieved without laborious library screenings. However, the flexibility of the proteins might still be underestimated during standard modeling protocols and should be closely evaluated.

Title = Integrative protein modeling in RosettaNMR from sparse paramagnetic restraints

Computational methods to predict protein structure from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints that only require assignment of backbone signals, hold great potential to study larger proteins. Ideally, computational methods designed to work with sparse data need to add atomic detail that is missing in the experimental restraints. We introduce a comprehensive framework into the Rosetta suite that uses NMR restraints derived from paramagnetic labeling. Specifically, RosettaNMR incorporates pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. It continues to use backbone chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser effect distance restraints. We assess RosettaNMR for protein structure prediction by folding 28 monomeric proteins and eight homo-oligomeric proteins. Furthermore, the general applicability of RosettaNMR is demonstrated on two protein-protein and three protein-ligand docking examples. Paramagnetic restraints generated more accurate models for 85% of the benchmark proteins and, when combined with chemical shifts, sampled high-accuracy models (≤2Å) in 50% of the cases.

NMR spectroscopy has limited application when it comes to large proteins. Labeling with paramagnetic metal ions provides additional long-range distance information for NMR. Kuenze et al. have developed a framework for the Rosetta modeling software that allows using paramagnetic restraints and traditional NMR data for protein structure prediction, protein docking and ligand docking.

Title = De novo design of modular peptide-binding proteins by superhelical matching

General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein–peptide systems, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.

A computational approach is used to design modular proteins that bind to synthetic peptides and disordered regions of human proteins with high affinity and specificity.

Title = Large-scale design and refinement of stable proteins using sequence-only models

Engineered proteins generally must possess a stable structure in order to achieve their designed function. Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values. We also report another network model that is able to generate the amino acid sequences of novel stable proteins given requested secondary sequences. Finally, we show that the predictive model—despite weaknesses including a noisy data set—can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.

Title = Robust deep learning based protein sequence design using ProteinMPNN

While deep learning has revolutionized protein structure prediction, almost all experimentally characterized de novo protein designs have been generated using physically based approaches such as Rosetta. Here we describe a deep learning based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, with outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4%, compared to 32.9% for Rosetta. Incorporation of noise during training improves sequence recovery on protein structure models, and produces sequences which more robustly encode their structures as assessed using structure prediction algorithms. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using X-ray crystallography, cryoEM and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target binding proteins.

A deep learning based protein sequence design method is described that is widely applicable to current design challenges and shows outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests.

Title = Holistic Approach to Partial Covalent Interactions in Protein Structure Prediction and Design with Rosetta

Partial covalent interactions (PCIs) in proteins, which include hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, cation–π, and π–π interactions, contribute to thermodynamic stability and facilitate interactions with other biomolecules. Several score functions have been developed within the Rosetta protein modeling framework that identify and evaluate these PCIs through analyzing the geometry between participating atoms. However, we hypothesize that PCIs can be unified through a simplified electron orbital representation. To test this hypothesis, we have introduced orbital based chemical descriptors for PCIs into Rosetta, called the PCI score function. Optimal geometries for the PCIs are derived from a statistical analysis of high-quality protein structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and the relative orientation of electron deficient hydrogen atoms and electron-rich lone pair or π orbitals are evaluated. We demonstrate that nativelike geometries of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, cation–π, and π–π interactions are recapitulated during minimization of protein conformation. The packing density of tested protein structures increased from the standard score function from 0.62 to 0.64, closer to the native value of 0.70. Overall, rotamer recovery improved when using the PCI score function (75%) as compared to the standard Rosetta score function (74%). The PCI score function represents an improvement over the standard Rosetta score function for protein model scoring; in addition, it provides a platform for future directions in the analysis of small molecule to protein interactions, which depend on partial covalent interactions.

Title = Using NMR chemical shifts and cryo-EM density restraints in iterative Rosetta-MD protein structure refinement

Cryo-EM has become one of the prime methods for protein structure elucidation, frequently yielding density maps with near-atomic or medium resolution. If protein structures cannot be deduced unambiguously from the density maps, computational structure refinement tools are needed to generate protein structural models. We have previously developed an iterative Rosetta-MDFF protocol that used cryo-EM densities to refine protein structures. Here we show that, in addition to cryo-EM densities, incorporation of other experimental restraints into the Rosetta-MDFF protocol further improved refined structures. We used NMR chemical shift (CS) data integrated with cryo-EM densities in our hybrid protocol in both the Rosetta step and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations step. In 15 out of 18 cases for all MD rounds, the refinement results obtained when density maps and NMR chemical shift data were used in combination outperformed those of density map-only refinement. Notably, the improvement in refinement was highest when medium and low-resolution density maps were used. With our hybrid method, the RMSDs of final models obtained were always better than the RMSDs obtained by our previous protocol with just density refinement for both medium (6.9 Å) and low (9 Å) resolution maps. For all the six test proteins with medium resolution density maps (6.9 Å), the final refined structure RMSDs were lower for the hybrid method than for the cryo-EM only refinement. The final refined RMSDs were less than 1.5 Å when our hybrid protocol was used with 4 Å density maps. For four out of the six proteins the final RMSDs were even less than 1 Å. This study demonstrates that by using a combination of cryo-EM and NMR restraints it is possible to refine structures to atomic resolution, outperforming single restraint refinement. This hybrid protocol will be a valuable tool when only low-resolution cryo-EM density data and NMR chemical shift data are available to refine structures.

Title = Improving NMR Protein Structure Quality by Rosetta Refinement: A Molecular Replacement Study

The structure of human protein HSPC034 has been determined by both solution NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Refinement of the NMR structure ensemble, using a Rosetta protocol in the absence of NMR restraints, resulted in significant improvements not only in structure quality, but also in molecular replacement (MR) performance with the raw X-ray diffraction data using MOLREP and Phaser. This method has recently been shown to be generally applicable with improved MR performance demonstrated for eight NMR structures refined using Rosetta. Additionally, NMR structures of HSPC034 calculated by standard methods that include NMR restraints, have improvements in the RMSD to the crystal structure and MR performance in the order DYANA, CYANA, XPLOR-NIH, and CNS with explicit water refinement (CNSw). Further Rosetta refinement of the CNSw structures, perhaps due to more thorough conformational sampling and/or a superior force field, was capable of finding alternative low energy protein conformations that were equally consistent with the NMR data according to the RPF scores. Upon further examination, the additional MR-performance shortfall for NMR refined structures as compared to the X-ray structure MR performance were attributed, in part, to crystal-packing effects, real structural differences, and inferior hydrogen bonding in the NMR structures. A good correlation between a decrease in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and improved MR performance demonstrates the importance of hydrogen-bond terms in the force field for improving NMR structures. The superior hydrogen-bond network in Rosetta-refined structures, demonstrates that correct identification of hydrogen bonds should be a critical goal of NMR structure refinement. Inclusion of non-bivalent hydrogen bonds identified from Rosetta structures as additional restraints in the structure calculation results in NMR structures with improved MR performance

Title = Protein tertiary structure prediction and refinement using deep learning and Rosetta in CASP14 

The trRosetta structure prediction method employs deep learning to generate predicted residue‐residue distance and orientation distributions from which 3D models are built. We sought to improve the method by incorporating as inputs (in addition to sequence information) both language model embeddings and template information weighted by sequence similarity to the target. We also developed a refinement pipeline that recombines models generated by template‐free and template utilizing versions of trRosetta guided by the DeepAccNet accuracy predictor. Both benchmark tests and CASP results show that the new pipeline is a considerable improvement over the original trRosetta, and it is faster and requires less computing resources, completing the entire modeling process in a median < 3 h in CASP14. Our human group improved results with this pipeline primarily by identifying additional homologous sequences for input into the network. We also used the DeepAccNet accuracy predictor to guide Rosetta high‐resolution refinement for submissions in the regular and refinement categories; although performance was quite good on a CASP relative scale, the overall improvements were rather modest in part due to missing inter‐domain or inter‐chain contacts.

Title = Measuring Intrinsic Disorder and Tracking Conformational Transitions using Rosetta ResidueDisorder

Many proteins contain regions of intrinsic disorder, not folding into unique, stable conformations. Numerous experimental methods have been developed to measure the disorder of all or select residues. In the absence of experimental data, computational methods are often utilized to identify these disordered regions and thus gain a better understanding of both structure and function. Many freely available computational methods have been developed to predict regions of intrinsic disorder from the primary sequence of a protein, including our recently developed Rosetta ResidueDisorder. While these methods are very useful, they are only designed to predict intrinsic disorder from the sequence. However, it would be useful to have a method that could also measure intrinsic disorder directly from structure. Such a method might also be used to identify changes in structure of systems that can transition from folded to unfolded or vice versa, even systems that are not intrinsically disordered. Here we extended the capabilities of Rosetta ResidueDisorder to measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates of a single conformation of a protein. As a proof of principle, we show that ResidueDisorder can measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates with a higher accuracy (69.2%) than when predicted from sequence (65.4%) using a benchmark set of 229 proteins, showing that intrinsic disorder can be measured accurately from single structures over a large range of intrinsic disorder (0–100%). Additionally, we used ResidueDisorder to analyze unfolding trajectories of 12 fast-folding, non-intrinsically disordered proteins generated using molecular dynamics (MD), specifically steered MD (SMD), high-temperature MD, and accelerated MD (aMD) as well as long-timescale folding/unfolding trajectories. Using ResidueDisorder, a clear correlation between RMSD with respect to the native structure and measured fraction of denatured residues was observed. Finally, we introduced methods to predict folding/unfolding transitions as well as a native-like structure in the absence of a crystal structure from folding/unfolding MD trajectories. Rosetta ResidueDisorder is available as an application in the Rosetta software suite with the addition of new capabilities for directly identifying denatured regions and predicting events.

Title = A lipophilicity-based energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design

Membrane-protein design is an exciting and increasingly successful research area which has led to landmarks including the design of stable and accurate membrane-integral proteins based on coiled-coil motifs. Design of topologically more complex proteins, such as most receptors, channels, and transporters, however, demands an energy function that balances contributions from intra-protein contacts and protein-membrane interactions. Recent advances in water-soluble all-atom energy functions have increased the accuracy in structure-prediction benchmarks. The plasma membrane, however, imposes different physical constraints on protein solvation. To understand these constraints, we recently developed a high-throughput experimental screen, called dsTβL, and inferred apparent insertion energies for each amino acid at dozens of positions across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we express these profiles as lipophilicity energy terms in Rosetta and demonstrate that the new energy function outperforms previous ones in modelling and design benchmarks. Rosetta ab initio simulations starting from an extended chain recapitulate two-thirds of the experimentally determined structures of membrane-spanning homo-oligomers with <2.5Å root-mean-square deviation within the top-predicted five models (available online: http://tmhop.weizmann.ac.il). Furthermore, in two sequence-design benchmarks, the energy function improves discrimination of stabilizing point mutations and recapitulates natural membrane-protein sequences of known structure, thereby recommending this new energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design.

Membrane proteins comprise a third of the genome and have essential roles as intermediaries between the cell and its environment. Despite exciting recent progress in membrane-protein modelling and design, however, these fields lag far behind advances in soluble proteins, chiefly because of inaccurate modelling of the membrane environment. Recently, our lab developed an assay, called dsTβL, that used high-throughput experimental screening to infer the energetics of each amino acid across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we encode the dsTβL energetics in the Rosetta software suite for biomolecular modelling and design and subject the energy function to three structure prediction and design benchmarks. The new energy function consistently outperforms the previous Rosetta membrane energy function. Additionally, ab initio structure prediction of homooligomeric membrane proteins results in accurate predictions in ⅔ of the examples in our benchmark. Therefore, we present a web server, called TMHOP, to compute the structures of single-pass homooligomeric membrane proteins directly from sequence. The results suggest that the automated design of large and complex membrane proteins is within reach.

Title = Modeling of protein conformational changes with Rosetta guided by limited experimental data

Conformational changes are an essential component of functional cycles of many proteins but their characterization often requires an integrative structural biology approach. Here, we introduce and benchmark ConfChangeMover (CCM), a new method built into the widely used macromolecular modeling suite Rosetta that is tailored to model conformational changes in proteins using sparse experimental data. CCM can rotate and translate secondary structural elements and modify their backbone dihedral angles in regions of interest. We benchmarked CCM on soluble and membrane proteins with simulated Cα-Cα distance restraints and sparse experimental double electron-electron resonance (DEER) restraints, respectively. In both benchmarks, CCM outperformed state-of-the-art Rosetta methods showing that it can model a diverse array of conformational changes. In addition, the Rosetta framework allows a wide variety of experimental data to be integrated with CCM, thus extending its capability beyond DEER restraints. This method will contribute to the biophysical characterization of protein dynamics.

Protein function relies on conformational changes of varying degrees. Computational and experimental methods alone have limited capacity of unveiling such transitions. Sala et al. have developed a method in the Rosetta modeling suite that allows to generate high-accuracy conformations consistent with sparse experimental data.

Title = De novo protein design by deep network hallucination

There has been considerable recent progress in protein structure prediction using deep neural networks to predict inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences. We investigated whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occurring proteins used in training the models. We generate random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting residue-residue distance maps, which as expected are quite featureless. We then carry out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (KL-divergence) between the distance distributions predicted by the network and the background distribution. Optimization from different random starting points results in novel proteins spanning a very wide range of sequences and predicted structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 network hallucinated sequences, expressed and purified the proteins in E. coli, and found that 27 folded to monodisperse species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. We determined the structures of three of the hallucinated proteins, two by x-ray crystallography and one by NMR, and these closely matched the hallucinated models. Thus deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute, alongside traditional physically-based models, to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.

In this chapter, we describe two protocols for membrane protein engineering with the Rosetta software: (1) ΔΔG calculations for single point mutations and (2) sequence optimization in different membrane lipid compositions. These modular protocols are easily adaptable for more complex problems and serve as a foundation for efficient membrane protein engineering calculations.

Title = Improved protein structure refinement guided by deep learning based accuracy estimation

We develop a deep learning framework (DeepAccNet) that estimates per-residue accuracy and residue-residue distance signed error in protein models and uses these predictions to guide Rosetta protein structure refinement. The network uses 3D convolutions to evaluate local atomic environments followed by 2D convolutions to provide their global contexts and outperforms other methods that similarly predict the accuracy of protein structure models. Overall accuracy predictions for X-ray and cryoEM structures in the PDB correlate with their resolution, and the network should be broadly useful for assessing the accuracy of both predicted structure models and experimentally determined structures and identifying specific regions likely to be in error. Incorporation of the accuracy predictions at multiple stages in the Rosetta refinement protocol considerably increased the accuracy of the resulting protein structure models, illustrating how deep learning can improve search for global energy minima of biomolecules.

Here the authors present DeepAccNet, a deep learning framework that estimates per-residue accuracy and residue-residue distance signed error in protein models, which are used to guide Rosetta protein structure refinement. Benchmarking suggests an improvement of accuracy prediction and refinement compared to other related state of the art methods.

Title = RosettaSurf—A surface-centric computational design approach

Proteins are typically represented by discrete atomic coordinates providing an accessible framework to describe different conformations. However, in some fields proteins are more accurately represented as near-continuous surfaces, as these are imprinted with geometric (shape) and chemical (electrostatics) features of the underlying protein structure. Protein surfaces are dependent on their chemical composition and, ultimately determine protein function, acting as the interface that engages in interactions with other molecules. In the past, such representations were utilized to compare protein structures on global and local scales and have shed light on functional properties of proteins. Here we describe RosettaSurf, a surface-centric computational design protocol, that focuses on the molecular surface shape and electrostatic properties as means for protein engineering, offering a unique approach for the design of proteins and their functions. The RosettaSurf protocol combines the explicit optimization of molecular surface features with a global scoring function during the sequence design process, diverging from the typical design approaches that rely solely on an energy scoring function. With this computational approach, we attempt to address a fundamental problem in protein design related to the design of functional sites in proteins, even when structurally similar templates are absent in the characterized structural repertoire. Surface-centric design exploits the premise that molecular surfaces are, to a certain extent, independent of the underlying sequence and backbone configuration, meaning that different sequences in different proteins may present similar surfaces. We benchmarked RosettaSurf on various sequence recovery datasets and showcased its design capabilities by generating epitope mimics that were biochemically validated. Overall, our results indicate that the explicit optimization of surface features may lead to new routes for the design of functional proteins.

Finely orchestrated protein-protein interactions are at the heart of virtually all fundamental cellular processes. Altering these processes or encoding new functions in proteins has been a long-standing goal in computational protein design. Protein design methods commonly rely on scoring functions that seek to identify amino acid sequences that optimize structural configurations of atoms while minimizing a variety of physics-based and statistical terms. The objectives of the large majority of computational design protocols have been focused on obtaining a predefined structural conformation. However, routinely introducing a functional aspect on designer proteins has been more challenging. Our results suggest that the molecular surface features can be a useful optimization parameter to guide the design process towards functional surfaces that mimic known protein binding sites and interact with their intended targets. Specifically, we demonstrate that our design method can optimize experimental libraries through computational screening, creating a basis for highly specific protein binders, as well as design a potent immunogen that engages with site-specific antibodies. The ability to create proteins with novel functions will be transformative for biomedical applications, providing many opportunities for the design of novel immunogens, protein components for synthetic biology, and other protein-based biotechnologies.

Title = De novo protein design, a retrospective

Proteins are molecular machines whose function depends on their ability to achieve complex folds with precisely defined structural and dynamic properties. The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.

Title = FlexPepDock lessons from CAPRI peptide–protein rounds and suggested new criteria for assessment of model quality and utility

CAPRI rounds 28 and 29 included, for the first time, peptide‐receptor targets of three different systems, reflecting increased appreciation of the importance of peptide‐protein interactions. The CAPRI rounds allowed us to objectively assess the performance of Rosetta FlexPepDock, one of the first protocols to explicitly include peptide flexibility in docking, accounting for peptide conformational changes upon binding. We discuss here successes and challenges in modeling these targets: we obtain top‐performing, high‐resolution models of the peptide motif for cases with known binding sites but there is a need for better modeling of flanking regions, as well as better selection criteria, in particular for unknown binding sites. These rounds have also provided us the opportunity to reassess the success criteria, to better reflect the quality of a peptide‐protein complex model. Using all models submitted to CAPRI, we analyze the correlation between current classification criteria and the ability to retrieve critical interface features, such as hydrogen bonds and hotspots. We find that loosening the backbone (and ligand) RMSD threshold, together with a restriction on the side chain RMSD measure, allows us to improve the selection of high‐accuracy models. We also suggest a new measure to assess interface hydrogen bond recovery, which is not assessed by the current CAPRI criteria. Finally, we find that surprisingly much can be learned from rather inaccurate models about binding hotspots, suggesting that the current status of peptide–protein docking methods, as reflected by the submitted CAPRI models, can already have a significant impact on our understanding of protein interactions.

Title = Automatically Fixing Errors in Glycoprotein Structures with Rosetta

Recent advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have resulted in determination of an increasing number of protein structures with resolved glycans. However, existing protocols for the refinement of glycoproteins at low resolution have failed to keep up with these advances. As a result, numerous deposited structures contain glycan stereochemical errors. Here, we describe a Rosetta-based approach for both cryoEM and X-ray crystallography refinement of glycoproteins that is capable of correcting conformational and configurational errors in carbohydrates. Building upon a previous Rosetta framework, we introduced additional features and score terms enabling automatic detection, setup, and refinement of glycan-containing structures. We benchmarked this approach using 12 crystal structures and showed that glycan geometries can be automatically improved while maintaining good fit to the crystallographic data. Finally, we used this method to refine carbohydrates of the human coronavirus NL63 spike glycoprotein and of an HIV envelope glycoprotein, demonstrating its usefulness for cryoEM refinement.

New method for refinement of carbohydrates with low-resolution electron density

Improved physical geometry of glycans in protein structures

Compatible with cryoEM and X-ray crystallography data

Frenz et al. have developed a new method for refinement of glycoprotein structures against low-resolution cryoEM and X-ray crystallography data. This new method is able to make significantly larger changes to the glycan geometry compared with previous methods, including the ability to changing the glycan's anomer.

Title = Computational Prediction of Coiled–Coil Protein Gelation Dynamics and Structure

Protein hydrogels represent an important and growing biomaterial for a multitude of applications, including diagnostics and drug delivery. We have previously explored the ability to engineer the thermoresponsive supramolecular assembly of coiled–coil proteins into hydrogels with varying gelation properties, where we have defined important parameters in the coiled–coil hydrogel design. Using Rosetta energy scores and Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatic energies, we iterate a computational design strategy to predict the gelation of coiled–coil proteins while simultaneously exploring five new coiled–coil protein hydrogel sequences. Provided this library, we explore the impact of in silico energies on structure and gelation kinetics, where we also reveal a range of blue autofluorescence that enables hydrogel disassembly and recovery. As a result of this library, we identify the new coiled–coil hydrogel sequence, Q5, capable of gelation within 24 h at 4 °C, a more than 2-fold increase over that of our previous iteration Q2. The fast gelation time of Q5 enables the assessment of structural transition in real time using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that is correlated to coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealing the supramolecular assembling behavior of coiled–coils toward nanofiber assembly and gelation. This work represents the first system of hydrogels with predictable self-assembly, autofluorescent capability, and a molecular model of coiled–coil fiber formation.

Title = Tertiary motifs as building blocks for the design of protein‐binding peptides

Despite advances in protein engineering, the de novo design of small proteins or peptides that bind to a desired target remains a difficult task. Most computational methods search for binder structures in a library of candidate scaffolds, which can lead to designs with poor target complementarity and low success rates. Instead of choosing from pre‐defined scaffolds, we propose that custom peptide structures can be constructed to complement a target surface. Our method mines tertiary motifs (TERMs) from known structures to identify surface‐complementing fragments or “seeds.” We combine seeds that satisfy geometric overlap criteria to generate peptide backbones and score the backbones to identify the most likely binding structures. We found that TERM‐based seeds can describe known binding structures with high resolution: the vast majority of peptide binders from 486 peptide‐protein complexes can be covered by seeds generated from single‐chain structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that known peptide structures can be reconstructed with high accuracy from peptide‐covering seeds. As a proof of concept, we used our method to design 100 peptide binders of TRAF6, seven of which were predicted by Rosetta to form higher‐quality interfaces than a native binder. The designed peptides interact with distinct sites on TRAF6, including the native peptide‐binding site. These results demonstrate that known peptide‐binding structures can be constructed from TERMs in single‐chain structures and suggest that TERM information can be applied to efficiently design novel target‐complementing binders.

Title = Accurate positioning of functional residues with robotics-inspired computational protein design

Computational protein design promises to advance applications in medicine and biotechnology by creating proteins with many new and useful functions. However, new functions require the design of specific and often irregular atom-level geometries, which remains a major challenge. Here, we develop computational methods that design and predict local protein geometries with greater accuracy than existing methods. Then, as a proof of concept, we leverage these methods to design new protein conformations in the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase that change the protein’s preference for a key functional residue. Our computational methods are openly accessible and can be applied to the design of other intricate geometries customized for new user-defined protein functions.

Proteins achieve their complex functions, such as molecular recognition with high affinity and specificity, through intricate three-dimensional geometries in functional sites. To engineer new protein functions, accurate positioning of amino acid functional groups is therefore critical but has remained difficult to achieve by computational methods because of current limitations in the design of new conformations with arbitrary user-defined geometries. Here, we introduce two computational methods capable of generating and predicting new local protein geometries: fragment kinematic closure (FKIC) and loophash kinematic closure (LHKIC). FKIC and LHKIC integrate two approaches: robotics-inspired kinematics of protein conformations and insertion of peptide fragments. We show that FKIC and LHKIC predict native-like conformations at atomic accuracy and with up to 140-fold improvements in sampling efficiency over previous approaches. We then use these methods to create a design protocol, pull into place (PIP), to position functionally important side chains via design of backbone conformations. We validate PIP by remodeling a sizeable active site region in an enzyme and confirming the engineered new conformations of two designs with crystal structures. The described methods can be applied broadly to the design of user-defined geometries for new protein functions.

Title = Protein Structure Determination using Metagenome sequence data

Despite decades of work by structural biologists, there are still ~5200 protein families with unknown structure outside the range of comparative modeling. We show that Rosetta structure prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families, and that metagenome sequence data more than triples the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling. We then integrate metagenome data, contact based structure matching and Rosetta structure calculations to generate models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures; 206 are membrane proteins and 137 have folds not represented in the PDB. This approach provides the representative models for large protein families originally envisioned as the goal of the protein structure initiative at a fraction of the cost.

Title = Role of backbone strain in de novo design of complex α/β protein structures

We previously elucidated principles for designing ideal proteins with completely consistent local and non-local interactions which have enabled the design of a wide range of new αβ-proteins with four or fewer β-strands. The principles relate local backbone structures to supersecondary-structure packing arrangements of α-helices and β-strands. Here, we test the generality of the principles by employing them to design larger proteins with five- and six- stranded β-sheets flanked by α-helices. The initial designs were monomeric in solution with high thermal stability, and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of one was close to the design model, but for two others the order of strands in the β-sheet was swapped. Investigation into the origins of this strand swapping suggested that the global structures of the design models were more strained than the NMR structures. We incorporated explicit consideration of global backbone strain into the design methodology, and succeeded in designing proteins with the intended unswapped strand arrangements. These results illustrate the value of experimental structure determination in guiding improvement of de novo design, and the importance of consistency between local, supersecondary, and global tertiary interactions in determining protein topology. The augmented set of principles should inform the design of larger functional proteins.

The authors show that consideration of global backbone strain enables successful de novo design of larger αβ-proteins with five- and six- stranded β-sheets flanked by α-helices.

Title = rstoolbox - a Python library for large-scale analysis of computational protein design data and structural bioinformatics

Large-scale datasets of protein structures and sequences are becoming ubiquitous in many domains of biological research. Experimental approaches and computational modelling methods are generating biological data at an unprecedented rate. The detailed analysis of structure-sequence relationships is critical to unveil governing principles of protein folding, stability and function. Computational protein design (CPD) has emerged as an important structure-based approach to engineer proteins for novel functions. Generally, CPD workflows rely on the generation of large numbers of structural models to search for the optimal structure-sequence configurations. As such, an important step of the CPD process is the selection of a small subset of sequences to be experimentally characterized. Given the limitations of current CPD scoring functions, multi-step design protocols and elaborated analysis of the decoy populations have become essential for the selection of sequences for experimental characterization and the success of CPD strategies.

Here, we present the rstoolbox, a Python library for the analysis of large-scale structural data tailored for CPD applications. rstoolbox is oriented towards both CPD software users and developers, being easily integrated in analysis workflows. For users, it offers the ability to profile and select decoy sets, which may guide multi-step design protocols or for follow-up experimental characterization. rstoolbox provides intuitive solutions for the visualization of large sequence/structure datasets (e.g. logo plots and heatmaps) and facilitates the analysis of experimental data obtained through traditional biochemical techniques (e.g. circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance) and high-throughput sequencing. For CPD software developers, it provides a framework to easily benchmark and compare different CPD approaches. Here, we showcase the rstoolbox in both types of applications.

rstoolbox is a library for the evaluation of protein structures datasets tailored for CPD data. It provides interactive access through seamless integration with IPython, while still being suitable for high-performance computing. In addition to its functionalities for data analysis and graphical representation, the inclusion of rstoolbox in protein design pipelines will allow to easily standardize the selection of design candidates, as well as, to improve the overall reproducibility and robustness of CPD selection processes.

Title = Computational design of closely related proteins that adopt two well-defined but structurally divergent folds

Computational protein design has focused primarily on the design of sequences which fold to single stable states, but in biology many proteins adopt multiple states. We used de novo protein design to generate very closely related proteins that adopt two very different states—a short state and a long state, like a viral fusion protein—and then created a single molecule that can be found in both forms. Our proteins, poised between forms, are a starting point for the design of triggered shape changes.

The plasticity of naturally occurring protein structures, which can change shape considerably in response to changes in environmental conditions, is critical to biological function. While computational methods have been used for de novo design of proteins that fold to a single state with a deep free-energy minimum [P.-S. Huang, S. E. Boyken, D. Baker, Nature 537, 320–327 (2016)], and to reengineer natural proteins to alter their dynamics [J. A. Davey, A. M. Damry, N. K. Goto, R. A. Chica, Nat. Chem. Biol. 13, 1280–1285 (2017)] or fold [P. A. Alexander, Y. He, Y. Chen, J. Orban, P. N. Bryan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 21149–21154 (2009)], the de novo design of closely related sequences which adopt well-defined but structurally divergent structures remains an outstanding challenge. We designed closely related sequences (over 94% identity) that can adopt two very different homotrimeric helical bundle conformations—one short (∼66 Å height) and the other long (∼100 Å height)—reminiscent of the conformational transition of viral fusion proteins. Crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic characterization shows that both the short- and long-state sequences fold as designed. We sought to design bistable sequences for which both states are accessible, and obtained a single designed protein sequence that populates either the short state or the long state depending on the measurement conditions. The design of sequences which are poised to adopt two very different conformations sets the stage for creating large-scale conformational switches between structurally divergent forms.

Title = Improving mass spectrometry analysis of protein structures with arginine-selective chemical cross-linkers

Chemical cross-linking of proteins coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (CXMS) is widely used to study protein-protein interactions (PPI), protein structures, and even protein dynamics. However, structural information provided by CXMS is still limited, partly because most CXMS experiments use lysine-lysine (K-K) cross-linkers. Although superb in selectivity and reactivity, they are ineffective for lysine deficient regions. Herein, we develop aromatic glyoxal cross-linkers (ArGOs) for arginine-arginine (R-R) cross-linking and the lysine-arginine (K-R) cross-linker KArGO. The R-R or K-R cross-links generated by ArGO or KArGO fit well with protein crystal structures and provide information not attainable by K-K cross-links. KArGO, in particular, is highly valuable for CXMS, with robust performance on a variety of samples including a kinase and two multi-protein complexes. In the case of the CNGP complex, KArGO cross-links covered as much of the PPI interface as R-R and K-K cross-links combined and improved the accuracy of Rosetta docking substantially.

Cross-linking mass spectrometry can provide insights into protein structures and interactions but its scope depends on the reactivity of the cross-linker. Here, the authors develop Arg-Arg and Lys-Arg cross-linkers, which provide structural information elusive to the widely used Lys-Lys cross-linkers.

Title = Programmable design of orthogonal protein heterodimers

Heterodimeric interaction specificity between two DNA strands, and between protein and DNA, is often achieved by varying side chains or bases coming off the protein or DNA backbone -- for example, the bases participating in Watson-Crick base pairing in the double helix, or the side chains of protein contacting DNA in TALEN-DNA complexes. This modularity enables the generation of an essentially unlimited number of orthogonal DNA-DNA and protein-DNA heterodimers. In contrast, protein-protein interaction specificity is often achieved through backbone shape complementarity , which is less modular and hence harder to generalize. Coiled coil heterodimers are an exception, but the restricted geometry of interactions across the heterodimer interface (primarily at the heptad a and d positions ) limits the number of orthogonal pairs that can be created simply by varying sidechain interactions . Here we demonstrate that heterodimeric interaction specificity can be achieved using extensive and modular buried hydrogen bond networks. We used the Crick generating equations  to produce millions of four helix backbones with varying degrees of supercoiling around a central axis, identified those accommodating extensive hydrogen bond networks, and used Rosetta to connect pairs of helices with short loops and optimize the remainder of the sequence. 65 of 97 such designs expressed in E. coli formed constitutive heterodimers, and crystal structures of four designs were in close agreement with the computational models and confirmed the designed hydrogen bond networks. In cells, a set of six heterodimers were found to be fully orthogonal, and in vitro, following mixing of 32 chains from sixteen heterodimer designs, denaturation in 5M GdnHCl and reannealing, the vast majority of the interactions observed by native mass spectrometry were between the designed cognate pairs. The ability to design orthogonal protein heterodimers should enable sophisticated protein based control logic for synthetic biology, and illustrates that nature has not fully explored the possibilities for programmable biomolecular interaction modalities.

Title = A general-purpose protein design framework based on mining sequence–structure relationships in known protein structures

Evolution has given us proteins that perform amazingly complex tasks in living systems, each molecule appearing “custom-built” for its particular purpose. Protein design seeks to enable the “custom building” of proteins at will, for specific tasks, without waiting for evolution. This is a grand challenge, because how a protein’s 3-dimensional structure and function are encoded in its amino acid sequence is exceedingly difficult to model. In this paper, we argue that sequence–structure encodings can instead be learned directly from proteins of known structure, which enables an approach to design. We are at an exciting time in protein science, where emergent principles inferred from data may allow us to make headway in cases where application of first principles is challenging.

Current state-of-the-art approaches to computational protein design (CPD) aim to capture the determinants of structure from physical principles. While this has led to many successful designs, it does have strong limitations associated with inaccuracies in physical modeling, such that a reliable general solution to CPD has yet to be found. Here, we propose a design framework—one based on identifying and applying patterns of sequence–structure compatibility found in known proteins, rather than approximating them from models of interatomic interactions. We carry out extensive computational analyses and an experimental validation for our method. Our results strongly argue that the Protein Data Bank is now sufficiently large to enable proteins to be designed by using only examples of structural motifs from unrelated proteins. Because our method is likely to have orthogonal strengths relative to existing techniques, it could represent an important step toward removing remaining barriers to robust CPD.

Title = The Role of Rigid Residues in Modulating TEM-1 β-Lactamase Function and Thermostability

The relationship between protein motions (i.e., dynamics) and enzymatic function has begun to be explored in β-lactamases as a way to advance our understanding of these proteins. In a recent study, we analyzed the dynamic profiles of TEM-1 (a ubiquitous class A β-lactamase) and several ancestrally reconstructed homologues. A chief finding of this work was that rigid residues that were allosterically coupled to the active site appeared to have profound effects on enzyme function, even when separated from the active site by many angstroms. In the present work, our aim was to further explore the implications of protein dynamics on β-lactamase function by altering the dynamic profile of TEM-1 using computational protein design methods. The Rosetta software suite was used to mutate amino acids surrounding either rigid residues that are highly coupled to the active site or to flexible residues with no apparent communication with the active site. Experimental characterization of ten designed proteins indicated that alteration of residues surrounding rigid, highly coupled residues, substantially affected both enzymatic activity and stability; in contrast, native-like activities and stabilities were maintained when flexible, uncoupled residues, were targeted. Our results provide additional insight into the structure-function relationship present in the TEM family of β-lactamases. Furthermore, the integration of computational protein design methods with analyses of protein dynamics represents a general approach that could be used to extend our understanding of the relationship between dynamics and function in other enzyme classes.

Title = Upgraded molecular models of the human KCNQ1 potassium channel

The voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 (KV7.1) assembles with the KCNE1 accessory protein to generate the slow delayed rectifier current, IKS, which is critical for membrane repolarization as part of the cardiac action potential. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in KCNQ1 are the most common cause of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), type 1 LQTS, an inherited genetic predisposition to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. A detailed structural understanding of KCNQ1 is needed to elucidate the molecular basis for KCNQ1 LOF in disease and to enable structure-guided design of new anti-arrhythmic drugs. In this work, advanced structural models of human KCNQ1 in the resting/closed and activated/open states were developed by Rosetta homology modeling guided by newly available experimentally-based templates: X. leavis KCNQ1 and various resting voltage sensor structures. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the capacity of the models to describe experimentally established channel properties including state-dependent voltage sensor gating charge interactions and pore conformations, PIP2 binding sites, and voltage sensor–pore domain interactions were validated. Rosetta energy calculations were applied to assess the utility of each model in interpreting mutation-evoked KCNQ1 dysfunction by predicting the change in protein thermodynamic stability for 50 experimentally characterized KCNQ1 variants with mutations located in the voltage-sensing domain. Energetic destabilization was successfully predicted for folding-defective KCNQ1 LOF mutants whereas wild type-like mutants exhibited no significant energetic frustrations, which supports growing evidence that mutation-induced protein destabilization is an especially common cause of KCNQ1 dysfunction. The new KCNQ1 Rosetta models provide helpful tools in the study of the structural basis for KCNQ1 function and can be used to generate hypotheses to explain KCNQ1 dysfunction.

Title = State-Targeting Stabilization of Adenosine A2A Receptor by Fusing a Custom-Made De Novo Designed α-Helical Protein

G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known for their low stability and large conformational changes upon transitions between multiple states. A widely used method for stabilizing these receptors is to make chimeric receptors by fusing soluble proteins (i.e., fusion partner proteins) into the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) connecting the transmembrane helices 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6). However, this fusion approach requires experimental trial and error to identify appropriate soluble proteins, residue positions, and linker lengths for making the fusion. Moreover, this approach has not provided state-targeting stabilization of GPCRs. Here, to rationally stabilize a class A GPCR, adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) in a target state, we carried out the custom-made de novo design of α-helical fusion partner proteins, which can fix the conformation of TM5 and TM6 to that in an inactive state of A2AR through straight helical connections without any kinks or intervening loops. The chimeric A2AR fused with one of the designs (FiX1) exhibited increased thermal stability. Moreover, compared with the wild type, the binding affinity of the chimera against the agonist NECA was significantly decreased, whereas that against the inverse agonist ZM241385 was similar, indicating that the inactive state was selectively stabilized. Our strategy contributes to the rational state-targeting stabilization of GPCRs.

Title = Integrated Structural Biology for Alpha-Helical Membrane Protein Structure Determination

While great progress has been made, only 10% of the nearly one thousand integral, α-helical, multi-span membrane protein families are represented by at least one experimentally determined structure in the protein data bank. Previously, we developed the algorithm BCL::MP-Fold, that samples the large conformational space of membrane proteins de novo by assembling predicted secondary structure elements guided by knowledge-based potentials. Here, we present a case study of rhodopsin fold determination by integrating sparse and/or low-resolution restraints from multiple experimental techniques including Electron Microscopy, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Simultaneous incorporation of orthogonal experimental restraints not only significantly improved the sampling accuracy, but also allowed identification of the correct fold, which is demonstrated by a protein size-normalized trans-membrane RMSD as low as 1.2Å. The protocol developed in this case study can be used for the determination of unknown membrane protein folds when limited experimental restraints are available.

Xia et al. developed a computational structure prediction pipeline to utilize multiple experimental restraints to fold membrane proteins in BCL and Rosetta. The pipeline described in the manuscript could determine structures to an accuracy of 1.2Å RMSD relative to the experimentally determined structural model.

Title = Dissecting the stability determinants of a challenging de novo protein fold using massively parallel design and experimentation

Most computationally designed proteins fail to fold into their designed structures. This low success rate is a major obstacle to expanding the applications of protein design. In previous work, we discovered a small protein fold that was paradoxically challenging to design (only a 2% success rate) even though the fold itself is very simple. Here, we used a recently developed high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine the design rules for this simple fold. By designing over 10,000 proteins and experimentally measuring their folding stability, we discovered the key biophysical properties that determine the stability of these designs. Our results illustrate general lessons for protein design and also demonstrate how high-throughput stability studies can quantify the importance of different biophysical forces.

Designing entirely new protein structures remains challenging because we do not fully understand the biophysical determinants of folding stability. Yet, some protein folds are easier to design than others. Previous work identified the 43-residue ɑββɑ fold as especially challenging: The best designs had only a 2% success rate, compared to 39 to 87% success for other simple folds [G. J. Rocklin et al., Science 357, 168–175 (2017)]. This suggested the ɑββɑ fold would be a useful model system for gaining a deeper understanding of folding stability determinants and for testing new protein design methods. Here, we designed over 10,000 new ɑββɑ proteins and found over 3,000 of them to fold into stable structures using a high-throughput protease-based assay. NMR, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, deep mutational scanning, and scrambled sequence control experiments indicated that our stable designs fold into their designed ɑββɑ structures with exceptional stability for their small size. Our large dataset enabled us to quantify the influence of universal stability determinants including nonpolar burial, helix capping, and buried unsatisfied polar atoms, as well as stability determinants unique to the ɑββɑ topology. Our work demonstrates how large-scale design and test cycles can solve challenging design problems while illuminating the biophysical determinants of folding.

Title = From Protein Design to the Energy Landscape of a Cold Unfolding Protein

Understanding protein folding is crucial for protein sciences. The conformational spaces and energy landscapes of cold (unfolded) protein states, as well as the associated transitions, are hardly explored. Furthermore, it is not known how structure relates to the cooperativity of cold transitions, if cold and heat unfolded states are thermodynamically similar, and if cold states play important roles for protein function. We created the cold unfolding 4-helix bundle DCUB1 with a de novo designed bipartite hydrophilic/hydrophobic core featuring a hydrogen bond network which extends across the bundle in order to study the relative importance of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic protein–water interactions for cold unfolding. Structural and thermodynamic characterization resulted in the discovery of a complex energy landscape for cold transitions, while the heat unfolded state is a random coil. Below ∼0 °C, the core of DCUB1 disintegrates in a largely cooperative manner, while a near-native helical content is retained. The resulting cold core-unfolded state is compact and features extensive internal dynamics. Below −5 °C, two additional cold transitions are seen, that is, (i) the formation of a water-mediated, compact, and highly dynamic dimer, and (ii) the onset of cold helix unfolding decoupled from cold core unfolding. Our results suggest that cold unfolding is initiated by the intrusion of water into the hydrophilic core network and that cooperativity can be tuned by varying the number of core hydrogen bond networks. Protein design has proven to be invaluable to explore the energy landscapes of cold states and to robustly test related theories.

Title = Improving the secretion of designed protein assemblies through negative design of cryptic transmembrane domains

Most biopharmaceuticals traverse the eukaryotic secretory pathway during their production as either recombinant proteins or as mRNA-delivered products. As designed proteins more commonly form the basis of new medicines, methods for optimizing their secretion will become increasingly important. Here we present a general computational method for improving protein secretion that focuses on the elimination of cryptic transmembrane domains while maintaining overall protein stability. We show that the method can retrospectively and prospectively improve the secretion of computationally designed protein nanoparticles, a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and therapeutics.

Computationally designed protein nanoparticles have recently emerged as a promising platform for the development of new vaccines and biologics. For many applications, secretion of designed nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells would be advantageous, but in practice, they often secrete poorly. Here we show that designed hydrophobic interfaces that drive nanoparticle assembly are often predicted to form cryptic transmembrane domains, suggesting that interaction with the membrane insertion machinery could limit efficient secretion. We develop a general computational protocol, the Degreaser, to design away cryptic transmembrane domains without sacrificing protein stability. The retroactive application of the Degreaser to previously designed nanoparticle components and nanoparticles considerably improves secretion, and modular integration of the Degreaser into design pipelines results in new nanoparticles that secrete as robustly as naturally occurring protein assemblies. Both the Degreaser protocol and the nanoparticles we describe may be broadly useful in biotechnological applications.

Title = Exploration of novel αβ-protein folds through de novo design

A fundamental question in protein evolution is whether nature has exhaustively sampled nearly all possible protein folds throughout evolution, or whether a large fraction of the possible folds remains unexplored. To address this question, we defined a set of rules for β-sheet topology to predict novel αβ-folds and carried out a systematic de novo protein design exploration of the novel αβ-folds predicted by the rules. The designs for all eight of the predicted novel αβ-folds with a four-stranded β-sheet, including a knot-forming one, folded into structures close to the design models. Further, the rules predicted more than 10,000 novel αβ-folds with five- to eight-stranded β-sheets; this number far exceeds the number of αβ-folds observed in nature so far. This result suggests that a vast number of αβ-folds are possible, but have not emerged or have become extinct due to evolutionary bias.

Here the authors carry out a systematic de novo protein design exploration of novel αβ-folds predicted under a defined set of rules for β-sheet topology, in an effort to find out the extent to which all possible αβ-folds are already sampled in nature.

Title = Structure-Guided Design of a Synthetic Mimic of an Endothelial Protein C Receptor-Binding PfEMP1 Protein

Vaccines train our immune systems to generate antibodies which recognize pathogens. Some of these antibodies are highly protective, preventing infection, while others are ineffective.

Structure-guided vaccine design provides a route to elicit a focused immune response against the most functionally important regions of a pathogen surface. This can be achieved by identifying epitopes for neutralizing antibodies through structural methods and recapitulating these epitopes by grafting their core structural features onto smaller scaffolds. In this study, we conducted a modified version of this protocol. We focused on the PfEMP1 protein family found on the surfaces of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum. A subset of PfEMP1 proteins bind to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and their expression correlates with development of the symptoms of severe malaria. Structural studies revealed that PfEMP1 molecules present a helix-kinked-helix motif that forms the core of the EPCR-binding site. Using Rosetta-based design, we successfully grafted this motif onto a three-helical bundle scaffold. We show that this synthetic binder interacts with EPCR with nanomolar affinity and adopts the expected structure. We also assessed its ability to bind to antibodies found in immunized animals and in humans from malaria-endemic regions. Finally, we tested the capacity of the synthetic binder to effectively elicit antibodies that prevent EPCR binding and analyzed the degree of cross-reactivity of these antibodies across a diverse repertoire of EPCR-binding PfEMP1 proteins. Despite our synthetic binder adopting the correct structure, we find that it is not as effective as the CIDRα domain on which it is based for inducing adhesion-inhibitory antibodies. This cautions against the rational design of focused immunogens that contain the core features of a ligand-binding site of a protein family, rather than those of a neutralizing antibody epitope.

IMPORTANCE Vaccines train our immune systems to generate antibodies which recognize pathogens. Some of these antibodies are highly protective, preventing infection, while others are ineffective. Structure-guided rational approaches allow design of synthetic molecules which contain only the regions of a pathogen required to induce production of protective antibodies. On the surfaces of red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are parasite molecules called PfEMP1 proteins. PfEMP1 proteins, which bind to human receptor EPCR, are linked to development of severe malaria. We have designed a synthetic protein on which we grafted the EPCR-binding surface of a PfEMP1 protein. We use this molecule to show which fraction of protective antibodies recognize the EPCR-binding surface and test its effectiveness as a vaccine immunogen.

Title = Rapid Sampling of Hydrogen Bond Networks for Computational Protein Design

Hydrogen bond networks play a critical role in determining the stability and specificity of biomolecular complexes, and the ability to design such networks is important for engineering novel structures, interactions, and enzymes. One key feature of hydrogen bond networks that makes them difficult to rationally engineer is that they are highly cooperative and are not energetically favorable until the hydrogen bonding potential has been satisfied for all buried polar groups in the network. Existing computational methods for protein design are ill-equipped for creating these highly cooperative networks because they rely on energy functions and sampling strategies that are focused on pairwise interactions. To enable the design of complex hydrogen bond networks, we have developed a new sampling protocol in the molecular modeling program Rosetta that explicitly searches for sets of amino acid mutations that can form self-contained hydrogen bond networks. For a given set of designable residues, the protocol often identifies many alternative sets of mutations/networks, and we show that it can readily be applied to large sets of residues at protein-protein interfaces or in the interior of proteins. The protocol builds on a recently developed method in Rosetta for designing hydrogen bond networks that has been experimentally validated for small symmetric systems, but was not extensible to many larger protein structures and complexes. The sampling protocol we describe here not only recapitulates previously validated designs with performance improvements, but also yields viable hydrogen bond networks for cases where the previous method fails, such as the design of large, asymmetric interfaces relevant to engineering protein-based therapeutics.

Title = Protein sequence optimization with a pairwise decomposable penalty for buried unsatisfied hydrogen bonds

In aqueous solution, polar groups make hydrogen bonds with water, and hence burial of such groups in the interior of a protein is unfavorable unless the loss of hydrogen bonds with water is compensated by formation of new ones with other protein groups. For this reason, buried “unsatisfied” polar groups making no hydrogen bonds are very rare in proteins. Efficiently representing the energetic cost of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds with a pairwise-decomposable energy term during protein design is challenging since whether or not a group is satisfied depends on all of its neighbors. Here we describe a method for assigning a pairwise-decomposable energy to sidechain rotamers such that following combinatorial sidechain packing, buried unsaturated polar atoms are penalized. The penalty can be any quadratic function of the number of unsatisfied polar groups, and can be computed very rapidly. We show that inclusion of this term in Rosetta sidechain packing calculations substantially reduces the number of buried unsatisfied polar groups.

We present an algorithm that fits into existing protein design software that allows researchers to penalize unsatisfied polar atoms in protein structures during design. These polar atoms usually make hydrogen-bonds to other polar atoms or water molecules and the absence of such interactions leaves them unsatisfied energetically. Penalizing this condition is tricky because protein design software only looks at pairs of amino acids when considering which amino acids to choose. Current approaches to solve this problem use additive approaches where satisfaction or unsatisfaction is approximated on a continuous scale; however, in reality, satisfaction or unsatisfaction is an all-or-none condition. The simplest all-or-none method is to penalize polar atoms for simply existing and then to give a bonus any time they are satisfied. This fails when two different amino acids satisfy the same atom; the pairwise nature of the protein design software will double count the satisfaction bonus. Here we show that by anticipating the situation where two amino acids satisfy the same polar atom, we can apply a penalty to the two amino acids in advance and assume the polar atom will be there. This scheme correctly penalizes unsatisfied polar atoms and does not fall victim to overcounting.

Title = Multi-state design of flexible proteins predicts sequences optimal for conformational change

Computational protein design of an ensemble of conformations for one protein–i.e., multi-state design–determines the side chain identity by optimizing the energetic contributions of that side chain in each of the backbone conformations. Sampling the resulting large sequence-structure search space limits the number of conformations and the size of proteins in multi-state design algorithms. Here, we demonstrated that the REstrained CONvergence (RECON) algorithm can simultaneously evaluate the sequence of large proteins that undergo substantial conformational changes. Simultaneous optimization of side chain conformations across all conformations increased sequence conservation when compared to single-state designs in all cases. More importantly, the sequence space sampled by RECON MSD resembled the evolutionary sequence space of flexible proteins, particularly when confined to predicting the mutational preferences of limited common ancestral descent, such as in the case of influenza type A hemagglutinin. Additionally, we found that sequence positions which require substantial changes in their local environment across an ensemble of conformations are more likely to be conserved. These increased conservation rates are better captured by RECON MSD over multiple conformations and thus multiple local residue environments during design. To quantify this rewiring of contacts at a certain position in sequence and structure, we introduced a new metric designated ‘contact proximity deviation’ that enumerates contact map changes. This measure allows mapping of global conformational changes into local side chain proximity adjustments, a property not captured by traditional global similarity metrics such as RMSD or local similarity metrics such as changes in φ and ψ angles.

Multi-state design can be used to engineer proteins that need to exist in multiple conformations or that bind to multiple partner molecules. In essence, multi-state design selects a compromise of protein sequences that allow for an ensemble of protein conformations, or states, associated with a particular biological function. In this paper, we used the REstrained CONvergence (RECON) algorithm with Rosetta to show that multi-state design of flexible proteins predicts sequences optimal for conformational change, mimicking mutation preferences sampled in evolution. Modeling optimal local side chain physicochemical environments within an ensemble selected significantly more native-like sequences than selections performed when all conformations states are designed independently. This outcome was particularly true for amino acids whose local side chain environment change between conformations. To quantify such contact map changes, we introduced a novel metric to show that sequence conservation is dependent on protein flexibility, i.e., changes in local side chain environments between stated limit the space of tolerated mutations. Additionally, such positions in sequence and structure are more likely to be energetically frustrated, at least in some states. Importantly, we showed that multi-state design over an ensemble of conformations (space) can explore evolutionary tolerated sequence space (time), thus enabling RECON to not only design proteins that require multiple states for function but also predict mutations that might be tolerated in native proteins but have not yet been explored by evolution. The latter aspect can be important to anticipate escape mutations, for example in pathogens or oncoproteins.

Title = Collective repacking reveals that the structures of protein cores are uniquely specified by steric repulsive interactions

Protein core repacking is a standard test of protein modeling software. A recent study of six different modeling software packages showed that they are more successful at predicting side chain conformations of core compared to surface residues. All the modeling software tested have multicomponent energy functions, typically including contributions from solvation, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding and Lennard–Jones interactions in addition to statistical terms based on observed protein structures. We investigated to what extent a simplified energy function that includes only stereochemical constraints and repulsive hard-sphere interactions can correctly repack protein cores. For single residue and collective repacking, the hard-sphere model accurately recapitulates the observed side chain conformations for Ile, Leu, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr and Val. This result shows that there are no alternative, sterically allowed side chain conformations of core residues. Analysis of the same set of protein cores using the Rosetta software suite revealed that the hard-sphere model and Rosetta perform equally well on Ile, Leu, Phe, Thr and Val; the hard-sphere model performs better on Trp and Tyr and Rosetta performs better on Ser. We conclude that the high prediction accuracy in protein cores obtained by protein modeling software and our simplified hard-sphere approach reflects the high density of protein cores and dominance of steric repulsion.

Title = The Stability Landscape of de novo TIM Barrels Explored by a Modular Design Approach

The TIM barrel is a versatile fold to understand structure-stability relationships.

A collection of de novo TIM barrels with improved hydrophobic cores was designed.

DeNovoTIMs are reversible in chemical and thermal unfolding, which is uncommon in TIM barrels.

Epistatic effects play a central role in DeNovoTIMs stabilization.

DeNovoTIMs navigate a previously uncharted region of the stability landscape.

The ability to design stable proteins with custom-made functions is a major goal in biochemistry with practical relevance for our environment and society. Understanding and manipulating protein stability provide crucial information on the molecular determinants that modulate structure and stability, and expand the applications of de novo proteins. Since the (β/⍺)8-barrel or TIM-barrel fold is one of the most common functional scaffolds, in this work we designed a collection of stable de novo TIM barrels (DeNovoTIMs), using a computational fixed-backbone and modular approach based on improved hydrophobic packing of sTIM11, the first validated de novo TIM barrel, and subjected them to a thorough folding analysis. DeNovoTIMs navigate a region of the stability landscape previously uncharted by natural TIM barrels, with variations spanning 60 degrees in melting temperature and 22 kcal per mol in conformational stability throughout the designs. Significant non-additive or epistatic effects were observed when stabilizing mutations from different regions of the barrel were combined. The molecular basis of epistasis in DeNovoTIMs appears to be related to the extension of the hydrophobic cores. This study is an important step towards the fine-tuned modulation of protein stability by design.

Title = Prediction of amphipathic helix—membrane interactions with Rosetta

Amphipathic helices have hydrophobic and hydrophilic/charged residues situated on opposite faces of the helix. They can anchor peripheral membrane proteins to the membrane, be attached to integral membrane proteins, or exist as independent peptides. Despite the widespread presence of membrane-interacting amphipathic helices, there is no computational tool within Rosetta to model their interactions with membranes. In order to address this need, we developed the AmphiScan protocol with PyRosetta, which runs a grid search to find the most favorable position of an amphipathic helix with respect to the membrane. The performance of the algorithm was tested in benchmarks with the RosettaMembrane, ref2015_memb, and franklin2019 score functions on six engineered and 44 naturally-occurring amphipathic helices using membrane coordinates from the OPM and PDBTM databases, OREMPRO server, and MD simulations for comparison. The AmphiScan protocol predicted the coordinates of amphipathic helices within less than 3Å of the reference structures and identified membrane-embedded residues with a Matthews Correlation Constant (MCC) of up to 0.57. Overall, AmphiScan stands as fast, accurate, and highly-customizable protocol that can be pipelined with other Rosetta and Python applications.

Amphipathic helices are important targets as antibacterial peptides and as domains of membrane proteins that play a role in sensing the membrane environment. Understanding how amphipathic helices interact with membrane enables us to design better peptides and understand how membrane proteins use them to interact with their environment. However, there is a limited number of tools available for the modeling of amphipathic helices in membranes. Implicit membrane models can be used for this purpose as simplistic representations of the membrane environment. In this work, we developed the AmphiScan protocol that can be used to predict membrane coordinates of amphipathic helices starting with a helix structure in an implicit membrane environment. We benchmarked the performance of AmphiScan on engineered LK peptides, naturally-occurring amphipathic helices, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides. Our approach provides a reliable and customizable tool to model amphipathic helix–membrane interactions, and pose a platform for the screening of amphipathic helix properties in silico.

Title = De novo protein design by citizen scientists

Online citizen science projects such as GalaxyZoo, Eyewire and Phylo have been very successful for data collection, annotation, and processing, but for the most part have harnessed human pattern recognition skills rather than human creativity. An exception is the game EteRNA, in which game players learn to build new RNA structures by exploring the discrete two-dimensional space of Watson-Crick base pairing possibilities. Building new proteins, however, is a more challenging task to present in a game, as both the representation and evaluation of a protein structure are intrinsically three-dimensional. We posed the challenge of de novo protein design in the online protein folding game Foldit. Players were presented with a fully extended peptide chain and challenged to craft a folded protein structure with an amino acid sequence encoding that structure. After many iterations of player design, analysis of the top scoring solutions, and subsequent game improvement, Foldit players can now, starting from an extended polypeptide chain, generate a diversity of protein structures and sequences which encode them in silico. 146 Foldit player designs with sequences unrelated to naturally occurring proteins were encoded in synthetic genes; 56 were found to be expressed in E. coli with good solubility and to adopt stable monomeric folded structures in solution. The diversity of these structures is unprecedented in de novo protein design, representing 20 different folds—including a new fold not observed in natural proteins. High resolution structures were determined for four of the designs, and are nearly identical to the player models. This work makes explicit the considerable implicit knowledge contributing to success in de novo protein design, and shows that citizen scientists can discover creative new solutions to outstanding scientific challenges, such as the protein design problem.

Title = Multiobjective heuristic algorithm for de novo protein design in a quantified continuous sequence space

Protein design usually involves sequence search process and evaluation criteria. Commonly used methods primarily implement the Monte Carlo or simulated annealing algorithm with a single-energy function to obtain ideal solutions, which is often highly time-consuming and limited by the accuracy of the energy function. In this report, we introduce a multiobjective algorithm named Hydra for protein design, which employs two different energy functions to optimize solutions simultaneously and makes use of the latent quantitative relationship between different amino acid types to facilitate the search process. The framework uses two kinds of prior information to transform the original disordered discrete sequence space into a relatively ordered space, and decoy sequences are searched in this ordered space through a multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm. This algorithm features high accuracy and a high-speed search process. Our method was tested on 40 targets covering different fold classes, which were computationally verified to be well folded, and it experimentally solved the 1UBQ fold by NMR in excellent agreement with the native structure with a backbone RMSD deviation of 1.074 Å. The Hydra software package can be downloaded from: http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/HYDRA/ for academic use.

Title = Serverification of Molecular Modeling Applications: The Rosetta Online Server That Includes Everyone (ROSIE)

The Rosetta molecular modeling software package provides experimentally tested and rapidly evolving tools for the 3D structure prediction and high-resolution design of proteins, nucleic acids, and a growing number of non-natural polymers. Despite its free availability to academic users and improving documentation, use of Rosetta has largely remained confined to developers and their immediate collaborators due to the code’s difficulty of use, the requirement for large computational resources, and the unavailability of servers for most of the Rosetta applications. Here, we present a unified web framework for Rosetta applications called ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone). ROSIE provides (a) a common user interface for Rosetta protocols, (b) a stable application programming interface for developers to add additional protocols, (c) a flexible back-end to allow leveraging of computer cluster resources shared by RosettaCommons member institutions, and (d) centralized administration by the RosettaCommons to ensure continuous maintenance. This paper describes the ROSIE server infrastructure, a step-by-step ‘serverification’ protocol for use by Rosetta developers, and the deployment of the first nine ROSIE applications by six separate developer teams: Docking, RNA de novo, ERRASER, Antibody, Sequence Tolerance, Supercharge, Beta peptide design, NCBB design, and VIP redesign. As illustrated by the number and diversity of these applications, ROSIE offers a general and speedy paradigm for serverification of Rosetta applications that incurs negligible cost to developers and lowers barriers to Rosetta use for the broader biological community. ROSIE is available at http://rosie.rosettacommons.org.

Title = Accurate Prediction of Enzyme Thermostabilization with Rosetta Using AlphaFold Ensembles

Thermostability enhancement is a fundamental aspect of protein engineering as a biocatalyst’s half-life is key for its industrial and biotechnological application, particularly at high temperatures and under harsh conditions. Thermostability changes upon mutation originate from modifications of the free energy of unfolding (ΔGu), making thermostabilization extremely challenging to predict with computational methods. In this contribution, we combine global conformational sampling with energy prediction using AlphaFold and Rosetta to develop a new computational protocol for the quantitative prediction of thermostability changes upon laboratory evolution of acyltransferase LovD and lipase LipA. We highlight how using an ensemble of protein conformations rather than a single three-dimensional model is mandatory for accurate thermostability predictions. By comparing our approaches with existing ones, we show that ensembles based on AlphaFold models provide more accurate and robust calculated thermostability trends than ensembles based solely on crystallographic structures as the latter introduce a strong distortion (scaffold bias) in computed thermostabilities. Eliminating this bias is critical for computer-guided enzyme design and evaluating the effect of multiple mutations on protein stability.

Title = Force field optimization guided by small molecule crystal lattice data enables consistent sub-Angstrom protein-ligand docking

Accurate and rapid calculation of protein-small molecule interaction free energies is critical for computational drug discovery. Because of the large chemical space spanned by drug-like molecules, classical force fields contain thousands of parameters describing atom-pair distance and torsional preferences; each parameter is typically optimized independently on simple representative molecules. Here we describe a new approach in which small molecule force field parameters are jointly optimized guided by the rich source of information contained within thousands of available small molecule crystal structures. We optimize parameters by requiring that the experimentally determined molecular lattice arrangements have lower energy than all alternative lattice arrangements. Thousands of independent crystal lattice-prediction simulations were run on each of 1,386 small molecule crystal structures, and energy function parameters of an implicit solvent energy model were optimized so native crystal lattice arrangements had the lowest energy. The resulting energy model was implemented in Rosetta, together with a rapid genetic algorithm docking method employing grid-based scoring and receptor flexibility. The success rate of bound structure recapitulation in cross-docking on 1,112 complexes was improved by more than 10% over previously published methods, with solutions within <1 Å in over half of the cases. Our results demonstrate that small molecule crystal structures are a rich source of information for guiding molecular force field development, and the improved Rosetta energy function should increase accuracy in a wide range of small molecule structure prediction and design studies.

Title = Rotamer Libraries for the High-Resolution Design of β-Amino Acid Foldamers

β-Amino acids offer attractive opportunities to develop biologically active peptidomimetics, either employed alone or in conjunction with natural α-amino acids. Owing to their potential for unique conformational preferences that deviate considerably from α-peptide geometries, β-amino acids greatly expand the possible chemistries and physical properties available to polyamide foldamers. Complete in silico support for designing new molecules incorporating non-natural amino acids typically requires representing their side-chain conformations as sets of discrete rotamers for model refinement and sequence optimization. Such rotamer libraries are key components of several state-of-the-art design frameworks. Here we report the development, incorporation in to the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite, and validation of rotamer libraries for β3-amino acids.

Title = Robustification of RosettaAntibody and Rosetta SnugDock

In recent years, the observed antibody sequence space has grown exponentially due to advances in high-throughput sequencing of immune receptors. The rise in sequences has not been mirrored by a rise in structures, as experimental structure determination techniques have remained low-throughput. Computational modeling, however, has the potential to close the sequence–structure gap. To achieve this goal, computational methods must be robust, fast, easy to use, and accurate. Here we report on the latest advances made in RosettaAntibody and Rosetta SnugDock—methods for antibody structure prediction and antibody–antigen docking. We simplified the user interface, expanded and automated the template database, generalized the kinematics of antibody–antigen docking (which enabled modeling of single-domain antibodies) and incorporated new loop modeling techniques. To evaluate the effects of our updates on modeling accuracy, we developed rigorous tests under a new scientific benchmarking framework within Rosetta. Benchmarking revealed that more structurally similar templates could be identified in the updated database and that SnugDock broadened its applicability without losing accuracy. However, there are further advances to be made, including increasing the accuracy and speed of CDR-H3 loop modeling, before computational approaches can accurately model any antibody.

Title = Computational design of mixed chirality peptide macrocycles with internal symmetry

Cyclic symmetry is frequent in protein and peptide homo‐oligomers, but extremely rare within a single chain, as it is not compatible with free N‐ and C‐termini. Here we describe the computational design of mixed‐chirality peptide macrocycles with rigid structures that feature internal cyclic symmetries or improper rotational symmetries inaccessible to natural proteins. Crystal structures of three C2‐ and C3‐symmetric macrocycles, and of six diverse S2‐symmetric macrocycles, match the computationally‐designed models with backbone heavy‐atom RMSD values of 1 Å or better. Crystal structures of an S4‐symmetric macrocycle (consisting of a sequence and structure segment mirrored at each of three successive repeats) designed to bind zinc reveal a large‐scale zinc‐driven conformational change from an S4‐symmetric apo‐state to a nearly inverted S4‐symmetric holo‐state almost identical to the design model. These symmetric structures provide promising starting points for applications ranging from design of cyclic peptide based metal organic frameworks to creation of high affinity binders of symmetric protein homo‐oligomers. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of computational design for exploring symmetries and structures not found in nature, and for creating synthetic switchable systems.

Title = Docking cholesterol to integral membrane proteins with Rosetta

Lipid molecules such as cholesterol interact with the surface of integral membrane proteins (IMP) in a mode different from drug-like molecules in a protein binding pocket. These differences are due to the lipid molecule’s shape, the membrane’s hydrophobic environment, and the lipid’s orientation in the membrane. We can use the recent increase in experimental structures in complex with cholesterol to understand protein-cholesterol interactions. We developed the RosettaCholesterol protocol consisting of (1) a prediction phase using an energy grid to sample and score native-like binding poses and (2) a specificity filter to calculate the likelihood that a cholesterol interaction site may be specific. We used a multi-pronged benchmark (self-dock, flip-dock, cross-dock, and global-dock) of protein-cholesterol complexes to validate our method. RosettaCholesterol improved sampling and scoring of native poses over the standard RosettaLigand baseline method in 91% of cases and performs better regardless of benchmark complexity. On the β2AR, our method found one likely-specific site, which is described in the literature. The RosettaCholesterol protocol quantifies cholesterol binding site specificity. Our approach provides a starting point for high-throughput modeling and prediction of cholesterol binding sites for further experimental validation.

Over 30% of the human proteome consists of integral membrane proteins. These proteins are critical in many biological processes, implicated in many diseases, and targeted by up to 50% of pharmaceutical drugs. The lipids of the membrane environment affect the function of integral membrane proteins. Protein-lipid interactions range from specific interactions at particular sites on the protein to nonspecific interactions involving changes to the physical membrane properties. It has become increasingly clear that cholesterol is one of the major proponents affecting integral membrane protein function. To study integral membrane protein-cholesterol interactions, we developed a docking algorithm in the Rosetta software, including a score that quantifies likely-specific interaction sites.

Title = PlaceWaters: Real-time, explicit interface water sampling during Rosetta ligand docking

Water molecules at the protein-small molecule interface often form hydrogen bonds with both the small molecule ligand and the protein, affecting the structural integrity and energetics of a binding event. The inclusion of these ‘bridging waters’ has been shown to improve the accuracy of predicted docked structures; however, due to increased computational costs, this step is typically omitted in ligand docking simulations. In this study, we introduce a resource-efficient, Rosetta-based protocol named “PlaceWaters” to predict the location of explicit interface bridging waters during a ligand docking simulation. In contrast to other explicit water methods, this protocol is independent of knowledge of number and location of crystallographic waters in homologous structures. We test this method on a diverse protein-small molecule benchmark set in comparison to other Rosetta-based protocols. Our results suggest that this coarse-grained, structure-based approach quickly and accurately predicts the location of bridging waters, improving our ability to computationally screen drug candidates.

Title = Computational Approaches to Predict Protein–Protein Interactions in Crowded Cellular Environments

Investigating protein–protein interactions is crucial for understanding cellular biological processes because proteins often function within molecular complexes rather than in isolation. While experimental and computational methods have provided valuable insights into these interactions, they often overlook a critical factor: the crowded cellular environment. This environment significantly impacts protein behavior, including structural stability, diffusion, and ultimately the nature of binding. In this review, we discuss theoretical and computational approaches that allow the modeling of biological systems to guide and complement experiments and can thus significantly advance the investigation, and possibly the predictions, of protein–protein interactions in the crowded environment of cell cytoplasm. We explore topics such as statistical mechanics for lattice simulations, hydrodynamic interactions, diffusion processes in high-viscosity environments, and several methods based on molecular dynamics simulations. By synergistically leveraging methods from biophysics and computational biology, we review the state of the art of computational methods to study the impact of molecular crowding on protein–protein interactions and discuss its potential revolutionizing effects on the characterization of the human interactome.

Title = An Investigation of Three-Finger Toxin—nAChR Interactions through Rosetta Protein Docking

Three-finger toxins (3FTX) are a group of peptides that affect multiple receptor types. One group of proteins affected by 3FTX are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Structural information on how neurotoxins interact with nAChR is limited and is confined to a small group of neurotoxins. Therefore, in silico methods are valuable in understanding the interactions between 3FTX and different nAChR subtypes, but there are no established protocols to model 3FTX–nAChR interactions. We followed a homology modeling and protein docking protocol to address this issue and tested its success on three different systems. First, neurotoxin peptides co-crystallized with acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) were re-docked to assess whether Rosetta protein–protein docking can reproduce the native poses. Second, experimental data on peptide binding to AChBP was used to test whether the docking protocol can qualitatively distinguish AChBP-binders from non-binders. Finally, we docked eight peptides with known α7 and muscle-type nAChR binding properties to test whether the protocol can explain the differential activities of the peptides at the two receptor subtypes. Overall, the docking protocol predicted the qualitative and some specific aspects of 3FTX binding to nAChR with reasonable success and shed light on unknown aspects of 3FTX binding to different receptor subtypes.

Title = Utilization of Hydrophobic Microenvironment Sensitivity in Diethylpyrocarbonate Labeling for Protein Structure Prediction

Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) labeling analyzed with mass spectrometry can provide important insight into higher order protein structure. It has been previously shown that neighboring hydrophobic residues promote a local increase in DEPC concentration such that serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues are more likely to be labeled despite low solvent exposure. In this work, we developed a Rosetta algorithm that used knowledge of labeled and unlabeled serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and assessed their local hydrophobic environment to improve protein structure prediction. Additionally, DEPC-labeled histidine and lysine residues with higher relative SASA values (i.e. more exposed) were scored favorably. Application of our score term led to reductions of the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the lowest scoring models. Additionally, models that scored well tended to have lower RMSDs. A detailed tutorial describing our protocol and required command lines is included. Our work demonstrated the considerable potential of DEPC covalent labeling data to be used for accurate higher order structure determination.

The voltage-gated sodium NaV1.7 channel plays a key role as a mediator of action potential propagation in C-fiber nociceptors and is an established molecular target for pain therapy. ProTx-II is a potent and moderately selective peptide toxin from tarantula venom that inhibits human NaV1.7 activation. Here we used available structural and experimental data to guide Rosetta design of potent and selective ProTx-II-based peptide inhibitors of human NaV1.7 channels. Functional testing of designed peptides using electrophysiology identified the PTx2-3127 and PTx2-3258 peptides with IC50s of 7 nM and 4 nM for hNaV1.7 and more than 1000-fold selectivity over human NaV1.1, NaV1.3, NaV1.4, NaV1.5, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9 channels. PTx2-3127 inhibits NaV1.7 currents in mouse and human sensory neurons and shows efficacy in rat models of chronic and thermal pain when administered intrathecally. Rationally designed peptide inhibitors of human NaV1.7 channels have transformative potential to define a new class of biologics to treat pain.

Title = A newly introduced salt bridge cluster improves structural and biophysical properties of de novo TIM barrels

Protein stability can be fine‐tuned by modifying different structural features such as hydrogen‐bond networks, salt bridges, hydrophobic cores, or disulfide bridges. Among these, stabilization by salt bridges is a major challenge in protein design and engineering since their stabilizing effects show a high dependence on the structural environment in the protein, and therefore are difficult to predict and model. In this work, we explore the effects on structure and stability of an introduced salt bridge cluster in the context of three different de novo TIM barrels. The salt bridge variants exhibit similar thermostability in comparison with their parental designs but important differences in the conformational stability at 25°C can be observed such as a highly stabilizing effect for two of the proteins but a destabilizing effect to the third. Analysis of the formed geometries of the salt bridge cluster in the crystal structures show either highly ordered salt bridge clusters or only single salt bridges. Rosetta modeling of the salt bridge clusters results in a good prediction of the tendency on stability changes but not the geometries observed in the three‐dimensional structures. The results show that despite the similarities in protein fold, the salt bridge clusters differently influence the structural and stability properties of the de novo TIM barrel variants depending on the structural background where they are introduced.

Title = Designer proteins that competitively inhibit Gαq by targeting its effector site

During signal transduction, the G protein, Gαq, binds and activates phospholipase C-β isozymes. Several diseases have been shown to manifest upon constitutively activating mutation of Gαq, such as uveal melanoma. Therefore, methods are needed to directly inhibit Gαq. Previously, we demonstrated that a peptide derived from a helix-turn-helix (HTH) region of PLC-β3 (residues 852–878) binds Gαq with low micromolar affinity and inhibits Gαq by competing with full-length PLC-β isozymes for binding. Since the HTH peptide is unstructured in the absence of Gαq, we hypothesized that embedding the HTH in a folded protein might stabilize the binding-competent conformation and further improve the potency of inhibition. Using the molecular modeling software Rosetta, we searched the Protein Data Bank for proteins with similar HTH structures near their surface. The candidate proteins were computationally docked against Gαq, and their surfaces were redesigned to stabilize this interaction. We then used yeast surface display to affinity mature the designs. The most potent design bound Gαq/i with high affinity in vitro (KD = 18 nM) and inhibited activation of PLC-β isozymes in HEK293 cells. We anticipate that our genetically encoded inhibitor will help interrogate the role of Gαq in healthy and disease model systems. Our work demonstrates that grafting interaction motifs into folded proteins is a powerful approach for generating inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.

Title = PconsFold: improved contact predictions improve protein models

Motivation: Recently it has been shown that the quality of protein contact prediction from evolutionary information can be improved significantly if direct and indirect information is separated. Given sufficiently large protein families, the contact predictions contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many protein families. However, since the first studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask how much the final models are improved if improved contact predictions are used.

Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33% using PconsFold compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that the quality is improved with 15–30% when using PconsC in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods. Further, using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with Rosetta is improved.

Availability: PconsFold is a fully automated pipeline for ab initio protein structure prediction based on evolutionary information. PconsFold is based on PconsC contact prediction and uses the Rosetta folding protocol. Due to its modularity, the contact prediction tool can be easily exchanged. The source code of PconsFold is available on GitHub at https://www.github.com/ElofssonLab/pcons-fold under the MIT license. PconsC is available from http://c.pcons.net/.

Title = Neural networks to learn protein sequence–function relationships from deep mutational scanning data

Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and function is necessary to design new and useful proteins with applications in bioenergy, medicine, and agriculture. The mapping from sequence to function is tremendously complex because it involves thousands of molecular interactions that are coupled over multiple lengths and timescales. We show that neural networks can learn the sequence–function mapping from large protein datasets. Neural networks are appealing for this task because they can learn complicated relationships from data, make few assumptions about the nature of the sequence–function relationship, and can learn general rules that apply across the length of the protein sequence. We demonstrate that learned models can be applied to design new proteins with properties that exceed natural sequences.

The mapping from protein sequence to function is highly complex, making it challenging to predict how sequence changes will affect a protein’s behavior and properties. We present a supervised deep learning framework to learn the sequence–function mapping from deep mutational scanning data and make predictions for new, uncharacterized sequence variants. We test multiple neural network architectures, including a graph convolutional network that incorporates protein structure, to explore how a network’s internal representation affects its ability to learn the sequence–function mapping. Our supervised learning approach displays superior performance over physics-based and unsupervised prediction methods. We find that networks that capture nonlinear interactions and share parameters across sequence positions are important for learning the relationship between sequence and function. Further analysis of the trained models reveals the networks’ ability to learn biologically meaningful information about protein structure and mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the models’ ability to navigate sequence space and design new proteins beyond the training set. We applied the protein G B1 domain (GB1) models to design a sequence that binds to immunoglobulin G with substantially higher affinity than wild-type GB1.

Title = Modular repeat protein sculpting using rigid helical junctions

The ability to robustly control macromolecular shape on the nanometer length scale is important for a wide range of biomedical and materials applications. DNA nanotechnology has achieved considerable success in building up complex structures from a small number of types of building blocks. We describe a large library of protein building blocks and junctions between them that enable the design of proteins with a wide range of shapes through modular combination of blocks rather than traditional and more complex design at the level of amino acid residues.

The ability to precisely design large proteins with diverse shapes would enable applications ranging from the design of protein binders that wrap around their target to the positioning of multiple functional sites in specified orientations. We describe a protein backbone design method for generating a wide range of rigid fusions between helix-containing proteins and use it to design 75,000 structurally unique junctions between monomeric and homo-oligomeric de novo designed and ankyrin repeat proteins (RPs). Of the junction designs that were experimentally characterized, 82% have circular dichroism and solution small-angle X-ray scattering profiles consistent with the design models and are stable at 95 °C. Crystal structures of four designed junctions were in close agreement with the design models with rmsds ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 Å. Electron microscopic images of extended tetrameric structures and ∼10-nm-diameter “L” and “V” shapes generated using the junctions are close to the design models, demonstrating the control the rigid junctions provide for protein shape sculpting over multiple nanometer length scales.

Title = iCFN: an efficient exact algorithm for multistate protein design

Multistate protein design addresses real-world challenges, such as multi-specificity design and backbone flexibility, by considering both positive and negative protein states with an ensemble of substates for each. It also presents an enormous challenge to exact algorithms that guarantee the optimal solutions and enable a direct test of mechanistic hypotheses behind models. However, efficient exact algorithms are lacking for multistate protein design.

We have developed an efficient exact algorithm called interconnected cost function networks (iCFN) for multistate protein design. Its generic formulation allows for a wide array of applications such as stability, affinity and specificity designs while addressing concerns such as global flexibility of protein backbones. iCFN treats each substate design as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP) modeled through a CFN; and it solves the coupled WCSPs using novel bounds and a depth-first branch-and-bound search over a tree structure of sequences, substates, and conformations. When iCFN is applied to specificity design of a T-cell receptor, a problem of unprecedented size to exact methods, it drastically reduces search space and running time to make the problem tractable. Moreover, iCFN generates experimentally-agreeing receptor designs with improved accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, highlights the importance of modeling backbone flexibility in protein design, and reveals molecular mechanisms underlying binding specificity.

Title = Current structure predictors are not learning the physics of protein folding

 Motivation. Predicting the native state of a protein has long been considered a gateway problem for understanding protein folding. Recent advances in structural modeling driven by deep learning have achieved unprecedented success at predicting a protein’s crystal structure, but it is not clear if these models are learning the physics of how proteins dynamically fold into their equilibrium structure or are just accurate knowledge-based predictors of the final state. 

 Results. In this work, we compare the pathways generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods to experimental data about protein folding pathways. The methods considered were AlphaFold 2, RoseTTAFold, trRosetta, RaptorX, DMPfold, EVfold, SAINT2 and Rosetta. We find evidence that their simulated dynamics capture some information about the folding pathway, but their predictive ability is worse than a trivial classifier using sequence-agnostic features like chain length. The folding trajectories produced are also uncorrelated with experimental observables such as intermediate structures and the folding rate constant. These results suggest that recent advances in structure prediction do not yet provide an enhanced understanding of protein folding.

Title = Resolution-adapted recombination of structural features significantly improves sampling in restraint-guided structure calculation

Recent work has shown that NMR structures can be determined by integrating sparse NMR data with structure prediction methods such as Rosetta. The experimental data serve to guide the search for the lowest energy state towards the deep minimum at the native state which is frequently missed in Rosetta de novo structure calculations. However, as the protein size increases, sampling again becomes limiting; for example, the standard Rosetta protocol involving Monte Carlo fragment insertion starting from an extended chain fails to converge for proteins over 150 amino acids even with guidance from chemical shifts (CS-Rosetta) and other NMR data. The primary limitation of this protocol—that every folding trajectory is completely independent of every other—was recently overcome with the development of a new approach involving resolution-adapted structural recombination (RASREC). Here we describe the RASREC approach in detail and compare it to standard CS-Rosetta. We show that the improved sampling of RASREC is essential in obtaining accurate structures over a benchmark set of 11 proteins in the 15-25 kDa size range using chemical shifts, backbone RDCs and HN-HN NOE data; in a number of cases the improved sampling methodology makes a larger contribution than incorporation of additional experimental data. Experimental data are invaluable for guiding sampling to the vicinity of the global energy minimum, but for larger proteins, the standard Rosetta fold-from-extended-chain protocol does not converge on the native minimum even with experimental data and the more powerful RASREC approach is necessary to converge to accurate solutions.

Title = Computationally designed peptide macrocycle inhibitors of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1

Peptide macrocycles are a promising class of drugs, but their weakness is conformational flexibility: target affinity can be limited by an unfavorable transition from a disordered unbound state to an ordered bound state. We introduce general computational methods for stabilizing peptide macrocycles in binding-competent conformations as part of the process of designing for binding to a target protein. As a proof of principle, we apply our methods to create inhibitors of the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1, an antibiotic resistance factor. Predictions of peptide rigidity correlate with experimental success, allowing designs to be prioritized for synthesis and testing. These methods should contribute to the design of peptide macrocycle inhibitors of diverse targets of therapeutic interest.

The rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new therapeutics targeting resistance factors such as the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), a bacterial enzyme that degrades β-lactam antibiotics. We present structure-guided computational methods for designing peptide macrocycles built from mixtures of l- and d-amino acids that are able to bind to and inhibit targets of therapeutic interest. Our methods explicitly consider the propensity of a peptide to favor a binding-competent conformation, which we found to predict rank order of experimentally observed IC50 values across seven designed NDM-1- inhibiting peptides. We were able to determine X-ray crystal structures of three of the designed inhibitors in complex with NDM-1, and in all three the conformation of the peptide is very close to the computationally designed model. In two of the three structures, the binding mode with NDM-1 is also very similar to the design model, while in the third, we observed an alternative binding mode likely arising from internal symmetry in the shape of the design combined with flexibility of the target. Although challenges remain in robustly predicting target backbone changes, binding mode, and the effects of mutations on binding affinity, our methods for designing ordered, binding-competent macrocycles should have broad applicability to a wide range of therapeutic targets.

Title = Accurate and efficient protein sequence design through learning concise local environment of residues

Computational protein sequence design has been widely applied in rational protein engineering and increasing the design accuracy and efficiency is highly desired.

Here, we present ProDESIGN-LE, an accurate and efficient approach to protein sequence design. ProDESIGN-LE adopts a concise but informative representation of the residue’s local environment and trains a transformer to learn the correlation between local environment of residues and their amino acid types. For a target backbone structure, ProDESIGN-LE uses the transformer to assign an appropriate residue type for each position based on its local environment within this structure, eventually acquiring a designed sequence with all residues fitting well with their local environments. We applied ProDESIGN-LE to design sequences for 68 naturally occurring and 129 hallucinated proteins within 20 s per protein on average. The designed proteins have their predicted structures perfectly resembling the target structures with a state-of-the-art average TM-score exceeding 0.80. We further experimentally validated ProDESIGN-LE by designing five sequences for an enzyme, chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferase type III (CAT III), and recombinantly expressing the proteins in Escherichia coli. Of these proteins, three exhibited excellent solubility, and one yielded monomeric species with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the natural CAT III protein.

Title = Methodology for rigorous modeling of protein conformational changes by Rosetta using DEER distance restraints

We describe an approach for integrating distance restraints from Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy into Rosetta with the purpose of modeling alternative protein conformations from an initial experimental structure. Fundamental to this approach is a multilateration algorithm that harnesses sets of interconnected spin label pairs to identify optimal rotamer ensembles at each residue that fit the DEER decay in the time domain. Benchmarked relative to data analysis packages, the algorithm yields comparable distance distributions with the advantage that fitting the DEER decay and rotamer ensemble optimization are coupled. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the protonation-dependent transition of the multidrug transporter PfMATE to an inward facing conformation with a deviation to the experimental structure of less than 2Å Cα RMSD. By decreasing spin label rotamer entropy, this approach engenders more accurate Rosetta models that are also more closely clustered, thus setting the stage for more robust modeling of protein conformational changes.

Proteins transition between different conformations during function. Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy enables the direct observation of structural rearrangements that underpin these transitions. Typically, histograms of distances between spin labels, called distance distributions, are measured under different conditions. Structural rearrangements that underlie conformational transitions are manifested by changes in the averages and widths of the distance distributions. To transform these distance distributions into restraints for modeling alternate protein conformations, we developed an algorithm in the modeling suite Rosetta for direct analysis of DEER primary data that yield the optimum ensemble of spin label positions in space, referred to as rotamers, that account for the data. We benchmarked the effectiveness of this algorithm using experimental data collected in two proteins, the model system T4 Lysozyme and the multidrug transporter PfMATE in an outward-facing conformation. We then used optimized spin label rotamers to model the inward-facing conformation of PfMATE from the starting outward-facing conformation. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both precision and accuracy among the resulting models. Further improvement of this strategy will enable modeling of protein conformational changes involving complex modes of movements.

Title = Predicting Protein Complex Structure from Surface-Induced Dissociation Mass Spectrometry Data

Recently, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a viable method for elucidation of protein structure. Surface-induced dissociation (SID), colliding multiply charged protein complexes or other ions with a surface, has been paired with native MS to provide useful structural information such as connectivity and topology for many different protein complexes. We recently showed that SID gives information not only on connectivity and topology but also on relative interface strengths. However, SID has not yet been coupled with computational structure prediction methods that could use the sparse information from SID to improve the prediction of quaternary structures, i.e., how protein subunits interact with each other to form complexes. Protein–protein docking, a computational method to predict the quaternary structure of protein complexes, can be used in combination with subunit structures from X-ray crystallography and NMR in situations where it is difficult to obtain an experimental structure of an entire complex. While de novo structure prediction can be successful, many studies have shown that inclusion of experimental data can greatly increase prediction accuracy. In this study, we show that the appearance energy (AE, defined as 10% fragmentation) extracted from SID can be used in combination with Rosetta to successfully evaluate protein–protein docking poses. We developed an improved model to predict measured SID AEs and incorporated this model into a scoring function that combines the RosettaDock scoring function with a novel SID scoring term, which quantifies agreement between experiments and structures generated from RosettaDock. As a proof of principle, we tested the effectiveness of these restraints on 57 systems using ideal SID AE data (AE determined from crystal structures using the predictive model). When theoretical AEs were used, the RMSD of the selected structure improved or stayed the same in 95% of cases. When experimental SID data were incorporated on a different set of systems, the method predicted near-native structures (less than 2 Å root-mean-square deviation, RMSD, from native) for 6/9 tested cases, while unrestrained RosettaDock (without SID data) only predicted 3/9 such cases. Score versus RMSD funnel profiles were also improved when SID data were included. Additionally, we developed a confidence measure to evaluate predicted model quality in the absence of a crystal structure.

A surface-induced dissociation (SID) appearance energy (AE) provides a single restraint that can improve model selection of protein complex structures from protein−protein docking.

Title = ProtGPT2 is a deep unsupervised language model for protein design

Protein design aims to build novel proteins customized for specific purposes, thereby holding the potential to tackle many environmental and biomedical problems. Recent progress in Transformer-based architectures has enabled the implementation of language models capable of generating text with human-like capabilities. Here, motivated by this success, we describe ProtGPT2, a language model trained on the protein space that generates de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones. The generated proteins display natural amino acid propensities, while disorder predictions indicate that 88% of ProtGPT2-generated proteins are globular, in line with natural sequences. Sensitive sequence searches in protein databases show that ProtGPT2 sequences are distantly related to natural ones, and similarity networks further demonstrate that ProtGPT2 is sampling unexplored regions of protein space. AlphaFold prediction of ProtGPT2-sequences yields well-folded non-idealized structures with embodiments and large loops and reveals topologies not captured in current structure databases. ProtGPT2 generates sequences in a matter of seconds and is freely available.

Protein design aims to build novel proteins customized for specific purposes, thereby holding the potential to tackle many environmental and biomedical problems. Here the authors apply some of the latest advances in natural language processing, generative Transformers, to train ProtGPT2, a language model that explores unseen regions of the protein space while designing proteins with nature-like properties.

Title = XENet: Using a new graph convolution to accelerate the timeline for protein design on quantum computers

Graph representations are traditionally used to represent protein structures in sequence design protocols in which the protein backbone conformation is known. This infrequently extends to machine learning projects: existing graph convolution algorithms have shortcomings when representing protein environments. One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes. We compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosetta’s rotamer substitution protocol, used for protein side-chain optimization and sequence design. This use case is motivating because it both reduces the size of the search space for classical side-chain optimization algorithms, and allows larger protein design problems to be solved with quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers with limited qubit counts. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the memory consumption for classical pre-computation of rotamer energies in our use case by more than a factor of 3, the qubit consumption for an existing sequence design quantum algorithm by 40%, and the size of the solution space by a factor of 165. Additionally, XENet displayed an ability to handle deeper architectures than competing convolutions.

Graph data structures are ubiquitous in the field of protein design, and are at the core of the recent advances in machine learning brought forth by graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs have led to some impressive results in modeling protein interactions, but are still not as common as other tensor representations.

Most GNN architectures tend to put minimal emphasis on information stored on edges; however, protein modeling tools often use edges to represent vital geometric relationships about residue pair interactions. We show that a more advanced processing of edge attributes can lead to considerable benefits when modeling chemical data.

We introduce XENet and show it to have improved ability to represent protein structural data while allowing information about amino acid interactions to be stored on graph edges. We use XENet to intelligently simplify the optimization problem that is solved when designing proteins. This task is important to us and others because it allows larger proteins to be designed on near-term quantum computers. We show that XENet is able to train on our protein modeling data better than existing methods, successfully resulting in a dramatic decrease in protein design sample space with negligible loss in quality.

Title = A Benchmark Study of Loop Modeling Methods Applied to G Protein-Coupled Receptors

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are important drug discovery targets. Despite progress, many GPCR structures have not yet been solved. For these targets, comparative modeling is used in virtual ligand screening to prioritize experimental efforts. However, the structure of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) is often poorly predicted. This is significant due to involvement of ECL2 in ligand binding for many Class A GPCR. Here we examine the performance of loop modeling protocols available in the Rosetta (Cyclic Coordinate Descent [CCD], KIC with Fragments [KICF] and Next Generation KIC [NGK]) and Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software suites (de novo search). ECL2 from GPCR crystal structures served as the structure prediction targets and were divided into four sets depending on loop length. Results suggest that KICF and NGK sampled and scored more loop models with sub-angstrom and near-atomic accuracy than CCD or de novo search for loops of 24 or fewer residues. None of the methods were able to sample loop conformations with near-atomic accuracy for the longest targets ranging from 25 – 32 residues based on 1000 models generated. For these long loop targets, increased conformational sampling is necessary. The strongly conserved disulfide bond between Cys3.25 and Cys45.50 in ECL2 proved an effective filter. Setting an upper limit of 5.1 Å on the S-S distance improved the lowest RMSD model included in the top 10 scored structures in Groups 1–4 on average between 0.33 and 1.27 Å. Disulfide bond formation and geometry optimization of ECL2 provided an additional incremental benefit in structure quality.
