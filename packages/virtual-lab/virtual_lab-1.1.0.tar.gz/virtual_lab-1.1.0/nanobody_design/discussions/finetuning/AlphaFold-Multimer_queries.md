This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Computational Biologist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic "AlphaFold-Multimer" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on AlphaFold-Multimer to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on AlphaFold-Multimer. Include both queries about AlphaFold-Multimer generally as well as queries about how AlphaFold-Multimer relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on AlphaFold-Multimer (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Computational Biologist, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Computational Biologist

Certainly! To gather relevant scientific literature on AlphaFold-Multimer and its application in designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2, I would perform the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general information about AlphaFold-Multimer and its specific application in nanobody design for SARS-CoV-2:

```python
queries = [
    "AlphaFold-Multimer protein structure prediction",
    "AlphaFold-Multimer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein",
    "AlphaFold-Multimer nanobody design",
    "AlphaFold-Multimer SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders",
    "machine learning nanobody design SARS-CoV-2"
]
```

These queries should help in identifying key papers and resources that discuss the capabilities of AlphaFold-Multimer in predicting multimeric protein structures, its application to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and its role in the design of nanobody binders.
