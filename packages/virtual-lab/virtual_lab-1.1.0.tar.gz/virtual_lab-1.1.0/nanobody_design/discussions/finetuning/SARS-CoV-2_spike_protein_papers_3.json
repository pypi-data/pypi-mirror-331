We therefore generated a large nanobody repertoire to saturate the distinct and highly conserved available epitope space of SARS-CoV-2 spike, including the S1 receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain, and the S2 subunit, to identify new nanobody binding sites that may reflect novel mechanisms of viral neutralization. Structural mapping and functional assays show that indeed these highly stable monovalent nanobodies potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, display numerous neutralization mechanisms, are effective against emerging variants of concern, and are resistant to mutational escape. Rational combinations of these nanobodies that bind to distinct sites within and between spike subunits exhibit extraordinary synergy and suggest multiple tailored therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11076045\n\nTitle = Nanobody repertoire generated against the spike protein of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 remains efficacious against the rapidly evolving virus\n\nTo date, all major modes of monoclonal antibody therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2 have lost significant efficacy against the latest circulating variants. As SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages account for over 90% of COVID-19 infections, evasion of immune responses generated by vaccination or exposure to previous variants poses a significant challenge. A compelling new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 is that of single-domain antibodies, termed nanobodies, which address certain limitations of monoclonal antibodies. Here, we demonstrate that our high-affinity nanobody repertoire, generated against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Mast et al., 2021), remains effective against variants of concern, including omicron BA.4/BA.5; a subset is predicted to counter resistance in emerging XBB and BQ.1.1 sublineages. Furthermore, we reveal the synergistic potential of nanobody cocktails in neutralizing emerging variants. Our study highlights the power of nanobody technology as a versatile therapeutic and diagnostic tool to combat rapidly evolving infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 8043454\n\nTitle = Nanobody Repertoires for Exposing Vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2\n\nDespite the great promise of vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and future serious outbreaks are highly likely, so that multi-pronged containment strategies will be required for many years. Nanobodies are the smallest naturally occurring single domain antigen binding proteins identified to date, possessing numerous properties advantageous to their production and use. We present a large repertoire of high affinity nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with excellent kinetic and viral neutralization properties, which can be strongly enhanced with oligomerization. This repertoire samples the epitope landscape of the Spike ectodomain inside and outside the receptor binding domain, recognizing a multitude of distinct epitopes and revealing multiple neutralization targets of pseudoviruses and authentic SARS-CoV-2, including in primary human airway epithelial cells. Combinatorial nanobody mixtures show highly synergistic activities, and are resistant to mutational escape and emerging viral variants of concern. These nanobodies establish an exceptional resource for superior COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 8877688\n\nTitle = Allosteric Determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding with Nanobodies: Examining Mechanisms of Mutational Escape and Sensitivity of the Omicron Variant\n\nStructural and biochemical studies have recently revealed a range of rationally engineered nanobodies with efficient neutralizing capacity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and resilience against mutational escape. In this study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with single nanobodies Nb6, VHH E, and complex with VHH E/VHH V nanobody combination. We combined coarse-grained and all-atom molecular simulations and collective dynamics analysis with binding free energy scanning, perturbation-response scanning, and network centrality analysis to examine mechanisms of nanobody-induced allosteric modulation and cooperativity in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with these nanobodies. By quantifying energetic and allosteric determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with nanobodies, we also examined nanobody-induced modulation of escaping mutations and the effect of the Omicron variant on nanobody binding. The mutational scanning analysis supported the notion that E484A mutation can have a significant detrimental effect on nanobody binding and result in Omicron-induced escape from nanobody neutralization. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might exploit the plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to binding without compromising activity. The network analysis supported these findings showing that VHH E/VHH V nanobody binding can induce long-range couplings between the cryptic binding epitope and ACE2-binding site through a broader ensemble of communication paths that is less dependent on specific mediating centers and therefore may be less sensitive to mutational perturbations of functional residues. The results suggest that binding affinity and long-range communications of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with nanobodies can be determined by structurally stable regulatory centers and conformationally adaptable hotspots that are allosterically coupled and collectively control resilience to mutational escape.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 8951411\n\nTitle = Structural and Computational Studies of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding Mechanisms with Nanobodies: From Structure and Dynamics to Avidity-Driven Nanobody Engineering\n\nNanobodies provide important advantages over traditional antibodies, including their smaller size and robust biochemical properties such as high thermal stability, high solubility, and the ability to be bioengineered into novel multivalent, multi-specific, and high-affinity molecules, making them a class of emerging powerful therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Recent research efforts on the design, protein engineering, and structure-functional characterization of nanobodies and their binding with SARS-CoV-2 S proteins reflected a growing realization that nanobody combinations can exploit distinct binding epitopes and leverage the intrinsic plasticity of the conformational landscape for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to produce efficient neutralizing and mutation resistant characteristics. Structural and computational studies have also been instrumental in quantifying the structure, dynamics, and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with nanobodies. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of the current structural, biophysical, and computational biology investigations of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and their complexes with distinct classes of nanobodies targeting different binding sites is presented. The analysis of computational studies is supplemented by an in-depth examination of mutational scanning simulations and identification of binding energy hotspots for distinct nanobody classes. The review is focused on the analysis of mechanisms underlying synergistic binding of multivalent nanobodies that can be superior to single nanobodies and conventional nanobody cocktails in combating escape mutations by effectively leveraging binding avidity and allosteric cooperativity. We discuss how structural insights and protein engineering approaches together with computational biology tools can aid in the rational design of synergistic combinations that exhibit superior binding and neutralization characteristics owing to avidity-mediated mechanisms.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n[begin paper 6]\n\nPMCID = 7932109\n\nTitle = Structure-guided multivalent nanobodies block SARS-CoV-2 infection and suppress mutational escape\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are an important weapon in the battle against COVID-19. However, these large proteins are difficult to produce in the needed quantities and at low cost. Attention has turned to nanobodies, which are aptly named, single-domain antibodies that are easier to produce and have the potential to be administered by inhalation. Koenig et al. describe four nanobodies that bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and prevent infection of cells (see the Perspective by Saelens and Schepens). Structures show that the nanobodies target two distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Multivalent nanobodies neutralize virus much more potently than single nanobodies, and multivalent nanobodies that bind two epitopes prevent the emergence of viral escape mutants.\n\nScience, this issue p. eabe6230; see also p. \n\nSARS-CoV-2\u2013neutralizing nanobodies were combined to design potent multivalent nanobodies.\n\nThe global scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose unprecedented challenges to society, health care systems, and science. In addition to effective and safe vaccines, passive immunization by antibody-related molecules offers an opportunity to harness the vertebrate immune system to fight viral infections in high-risk patients. Variable domains of heavy-chain\u2013only antibodies (VHHs), also known as nanobodies, are suitable lead molecules in such efforts, as they are small, extremely stable, easy to engineer, and economic to produce in simple expression systems.\n\nWe engineered improved multivalent nanobodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of two principles: (i) detailed structural information of their epitopes and binding modes to the viral spike protein and (ii) mechanistic insights into viral fusion with cellular membranes catalyzed by the spike.\n\nNanobodies specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike were identified by phage display using nanobody libraries from an alpaca and a llama immunized with the RBD and inactivated virus. Four of the resulting nanobodies\u2014VHHs E, U, V, and W\u2014potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2\u2013pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus. X-ray crystallography revealed that the nanobodies bind to two distinct epitopes on the RBD, interfaces \u201cE\u201d and \u201cUVW,\u201d which can be synergistically targeted by combinations of nanobodies to inhibit infection. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of trimeric spike in complex with VHH E and VHH V revealed that VHH E stabilizes a conformation of the spike with all three RBDs in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (3-up), a state that is typically associated with activation by receptor binding. In line with this observation, we found that VHH E triggers the fusion activity of spike in the absence of the cognate receptor ACE2. VHH V, by contrast, stabilizes spike in a 2-up conformation and does not induce fusion. On the basis of the structural information, we designed bi- and trivalent nanobodies with improved neutralizing properties. VHH EEE most potently inhibited infection, did not activate fusion, and likely inactivated virions by outcompeting interaction of the virus with its receptor. Yet evolution experiments revealed emergence of escape mutants in the spike with single\u2013amino acid changes that were completely insensitive to inhibition by VHH EEE. VHH VE also neutralized more efficiently than VHH E or VHH V alone; stabilized the 3-up conformation of spike, as determined by cryo-EM; and more strongly induced the spike fusogenic activity. We conclude that the premature activation of the fusion machinery on virions was an unexpected mechanism of neutralization, as enhanced neutralization could not be attributed simply to better blocking of virus-receptor interactions. Activation of spike in the absence of target membranes likely induces irreversible conformational changes to assume the energetically favorable postfusion conformation without catalyzing fusion per se. Simultaneous targeting of two independent epitopes by VHH VE largely prevented the emergence of resistant escape mutants in evolution experiments.\n\nOur results demonstrate the strength of the modular combination of nanobodies for neutralization. Premature activation of spike by nanobodies reveals an unusual mode of neutralization and yields insights into the mechanism of fusion.\n\nOn virions, SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers are mostly in an inactive configuration with all RBDs in the down conformation (left). Binding of bivalent nanobody VE stabilizes the spike in an active conformation with all RBDs up (middle), triggering premature induction of the postfusion conformation, which irreversibly inactivates the spike protein (right).\n\nThe pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, with devastating consequences. For passive immunization efforts, nanobodies have size and cost advantages over conventional antibodies. In this study, we generated four neutralizing nanobodies that target the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used x-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy to define two distinct binding epitopes. On the basis of these structures, we engineered multivalent nanobodies with more than 100 times the neutralizing activity of monovalent nanobodies. Biparatopic nanobody fusions suppressed the emergence of escape mutants. Several nanobody constructs neutralized through receptor binding competition, whereas other monovalent and biparatopic nanobodies triggered aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery. These premature conformational changes in the spike protein forestalled productive fusion and rendered the virions noninfectious.\n\n[end paper 6]\n\n[begin paper 7]\n\nPMCID = 10986514\n\nTitle = Nanobody engineering for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and detection\n\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for coronavirus inhibitors has inspired research on a variety of small proteins beyond conventional antibodies, including robust single-domain antibody fragments, i.e., \u201cnanobodies.\u201d Here, we explore the potential of nanobody engineering in the development of antivirals and diagnostic tools. Through fusion of nanobody domains that target distinct binding sites, we engineered multimodular nanobody constructs that neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Delta variants at high potency, with IC50 values as low as 50 pM. Despite simultaneous binding to distinct epitopes, Beta and Omicron variants were more resistant to neutralization by the multimodular nanobodies, which highlights the importance of accounting for antigenic drift in the design of biologics. To further explore the applications of nanobody engineering in outbreak management, we present an assay based on fusions of nanobodies with fragments of NanoLuc luciferase that can detect sub-nanomolar quantities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a single step. Our work showcases the potential of nanobody engineering to combat emerging infectious diseases.\n\nNanobodies, small protein binders derived from the camelid antibody, are highly potent inhibitors of respiratory viruses that offer several advantages over conventional antibodies as candidates for specific therapies, including high stability and low production costs. In this work, we leverage the unique properties of nanobodies and apply them as building blocks for new therapeutic and diagnostic tools. We report ultra-potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by engineered nanobodies comprising multiple modules in structure-guided combinations and develop nanobodies that carry signal molecules, allowing rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results highlight the potential of engineered nanobodies in the development of effective countermeasures, both therapeutic and diagnostic, to manage outbreaks of emerging viruses.\n\n[end paper 7]\n\n[begin paper 8]\n\nPMCID = 8748511\n\nTitle = A bispecific monomeric nanobody induces spike trimer dimers and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vivo\n\nAntibodies binding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike have therapeutic promise, but emerging variants show the potential for virus escape. This emphasizes the need for therapeutic molecules with distinct and novel neutralization mechanisms. Here we describe the isolation of a nanobody that interacts simultaneously with two RBDs from different spike trimers of SARS-CoV-2, rapidly inducing the formation of spike trimer\u2013dimers leading to the loss of their ability to attach to the host cell receptor, ACE2. We show that this nanobody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the beta and delta variants, and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 and the beta variant in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. This naturally elicited bispecific monomeric nanobody establishes an uncommon strategy for potent inactivation of viral antigens and represents a promising antiviral against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nHere, the authors isolate and characterize a bispecific monomeric nanobody that induces dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers, neutralizes variants of concerns as well as SARS-CoV, and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.\n\n[end paper 8]\n\n[begin paper 9]\n\nPMCID = 11407660\n\nTitle = Dual-role epitope on SARS-CoV-2 spike enhances and neutralizes viral entry across different variants\n\nGrasping the roles of epitopes in viral glycoproteins is essential for unraveling the structure and function of these proteins. Up to now, all identified epitopes have been found to either neutralize, have no effect on, or enhance viral entry into cells. Here, we used nanobodies (single-domain antibodies) as probes to investigate a unique epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, located outside the protein\u2019s receptor-binding domain. Nanobody binding to this epitope enhances the cell entry of prototypic SARS-CoV-2, while neutralizing the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Moreover, nanobody binding to this epitope promotes both receptor binding activity and post-attachment activity of prototypic spike, explaining the enhanced viral entry. The opposite occurs with Omicron spike, explaining the neutralized viral entry. This study reveals a unique epitope that can both enhance and neutralize viral entry across distinct viral variants, suggesting that epitopes may vary their roles depending on the viral context. Consequently, antibody therapies should be assessed across different viral variants to confirm their efficacy and safety.\n\nAntibodies bind to specific epitopes on viral surface glycoproteins to perform their function: inhibiting viral infection, having no effect, or, in rare cases, enhancing viral infection. In our research, we used nanobodies (small, single-domain antibodies from camelid animals) as probes and identified a unique epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with opposing functions across different SARS-CoV-2 variants. It enhances viral infection in pre-Omicron variants but inhibits it in the Omicron variant. We further investigated the molecular mechanism underlying these opposing effects. Although this epitope is not directly involved in receptor binding, nanobody binding to it modulates receptor binding and post-receptor-binding activities. This study marks the first discovery of a dual-function epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that both enhances and inhibits viral infection across different viral variants. This discovery challenges the traditional categorization of epitopes, underscores the complex evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and offers new insights into antiviral antibody therapies.\n\n[end paper 9]\n\n[begin paper 10]\n\nPMCID = 9655607\n\nTitle = In Silico Approach for the Evaluation of the Potential Antiviral Activity of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) Bioactive Constituents Oleuropein and Oleocanthal on Spike Therapeutic Drug Target of SARS-CoV-2\n\nSince there is an urgent need for novel treatments to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in silico molecular docking studies were implemented as an attempt to explore the ability of selected bioactive constituents of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) to act as potent SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antiviral compounds, aiming to explore their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike key therapeutic target protein. Our results suggest that EVOO constituents display substantial capacity for binding and interfering with Spike (S) protein, both wild-type and mutant, via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike, or other binding targets such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or the RBD-ACE2 protein complex, inhibiting the interaction of the virus with host cells. This in silico study provides useful insights for the understanding of the mechanism of action of the studied compounds at a molecular level.

Imbalances in the accessibility of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostics among countries, regions, and populations, and those in war crises, have been problematic. Nanobodies are small, stable, customizable, and inexpensive to produce. Herein, we present a panel of nanobodies that can detect the spike proteins of five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) including Omicron. Here we show via ELISA, lateral flow, kinetic, flow cytometric, microscopy, and Western blotting assays that our nanobodies can quantify the spike variants. This panel of nanobodies broadly neutralizes viral infection caused by pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Structural analyses show that the P86 clone targets epitopes that are conserved yet unclassified on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and contacts the N-terminal domain (NTD). Human antibodies rarely access both regions; consequently, the clone buries hidden crevasses of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that go undetected by conventional antibodies.\n\nA panel of nanobodies are presented that can detect the spike proteins of five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and structural analyses show that one clone targets conserved epitopes on the receptor-binding domain and contacts the N-terminal domain.\n\n[end paper 11]\n\n[begin paper 12]\n\nPMCID = 9043892\n\nTitle = Passive Immunotherapy Against SARS-CoV-2: From Plasma-Based Therapy to Single Potent Antibodies in the Race to Stay Ahead of the Variants\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is now approaching 2 years old, with more than 440 million people infected and nearly six million dead worldwide, making it the most significant pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. The severity and significance of SARS-CoV-2 was recognized immediately upon discovery, leading to innumerable companies and institutes designing and generating vaccines and therapeutic antibodies literally as soon as recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence was available. Within months of the pandemic start, several antibodies had been generated, tested, and moved into clinical trials, including Eli Lilly\u2019s bamlanivimab and etesevimab, Regeneron\u2019s mixture of imdevimab and casirivimab, Vir\u2019s sotrovimab, Celltrion\u2019s regdanvimab, and Lilly\u2019s bebtelovimab. These antibodies all have now received at least Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) and some have received full approval in select countries. To date, more than three dozen antibodies or antibody combinations have been forwarded into clinical trials. These antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 all target the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with some blocking the ability of the RBD to bind human ACE2, while others bind core regions of the RBD to modulate spike stability or ability to fuse to host cell membranes. While these antibodies were being discovered and developed, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have cropped up in real time, altering the antibody landscape on a moving basis. Over the past year, the search has widened to find antibodies capable of neutralizing the wide array of variants that have arisen, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. The recent rise and dominance of the Omicron family of variants, including the rather disparate BA.1 and BA.2 variants, demonstrate the need to continue to find new approaches to neutralize the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review highlights both convalescent plasma- and polyclonal antibody-based approaches as well as the top approximately 50 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their epitopes, their ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 variants, and how they are delivered. New approaches to antibody constructs, including single domain antibodies, bispecific antibodies, IgA- and IgM-based antibodies, and modified ACE2-Fc fusion proteins, are also described. Finally, antibodies being developed for palliative care of COVID-19 disease, including the ramifications of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are described.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40259-022-00529-7.\n\n[end paper 12]\n\n[begin paper 13]\n\nPMCID = 11285730\n\nTitle = Structural and functional characterization of nanobodies that neutralize Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2\n\nThe Omicron strains of SARS-CoV-2 pose a significant challenge to the development of effective antibody-based treatments as immune evasion has compromised most available immune therapeutics. Therefore, in the \u2018arms race\u2019 with the virus, there is a continuing need to identify new biologics for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here, we report the isolation of nanobodies that bind to the Omicron BA.1 spike protein by screening nanobody phage display libraries previously generated from llamas immunized with either the Wuhan or Beta spike proteins. The structure and binding properties of three of these nanobodies (A8, H6 and B5-5) have been characterized in detail providing insight into their binding epitopes on the Omicron spike protein. Trimeric versions of H6 and B5-5 neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern BA.5 both in vitro and in the hamster model of COVID-19 following nasal administration. Thus, either alone or in combination could serve as starting points for the development of new anti-viral immunotherapeutics.\n\n[end paper 13]\n\n[begin paper 14]\n\nPMCID = 9365158\n\nTitle = A humanized nanobody phage display library yields potent binders of SARS CoV-2 spike\n\nNeutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have shown a great preventative/therapeutic potential. Here, we report a rapid and efficient strategy for the development and design of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing humanized nanobody constructs with sub-nanomolar affinities and nanomolar potencies. CryoEM-based structural analysis of the nanobodies in complex with spike revealed two distinct binding modes. The most potent nanobody, RBD-1-2G(NCATS-BL8125), tolerates the N501Y RBD mutation and remains capable of neutralizing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a structural basis for understanding the neutralization process of nanobodies exclusively focused on the spike-ACE2 interface with and without the N501Y mutation on RBD. A primary human airway air-lung interface (ALI) ex vivo model showed that RBD-1-2G-Fc antibody treatment was effective at reducing viral burden following WA1 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, this presented strategy will serve as a tool to mitigate the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n[end paper 14]\n\n[begin paper 15]\n\nPMCID = 11401216\n\nTitle = Nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein Nsp9 inhibits viral replication in human airway epithelia\n\nNanobodies are emerging as critical tools for drug design. Several have been recently created to serve as inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus s (SARS-CoV-2) entry in the host cell by targeting surface-exposed spike protein. Here we have established a pipeline that instead targets highly conserved viral proteins made only after viral entry into the host cell when the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based genome is translated. As proof of principle, we designed nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (Nsp)9, which is required for viral genome replication. One of these anti-Nsp9 nanobodies, 2NSP23, previously characterized using immunoassays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for\u00a0epitope mapping, was expressed and found to block SARS-CoV-2 replication specifically. We next encapsulated 2NSP23 nanobody into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as mRNA. We show that this nanobody, hereby referred to as LNP-mRNA-2NSP23, is internalized and translated in cells and suppresses multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, as seen by qPCR and RNA deep sequencing. These results are corroborated in three-dimensional reconstituted human epithelium kept at air-liquid interface to mimic the outer surface of lung tissue. These observations indicate that LNP-mRNA-2NSP23 is internalized and, after translation, it inhibits viral replication by targeting Nsp9 in living cells. We speculate that\u00a0LNP-mRNA-2NSP23 may be translated into an innovative strategy to generate novel antiviral drugs highly efficient across coronaviruses.\n\nPercipalle and colleagues identified a novel nanobody-based therapy against SARS-CoV-2 by using mRNA encoding a nanobody targeting SARS-CoV-2 NSP9, encapsulated in LNPs. These nanoparticles are internalized and mRNA is translated into functional nanobody in human airway epithelia to block viral replication.\n\n[end paper 15]\n\n[begin paper 16]\n\nPMCID = 8126837\n\nTitle = Nanobody cocktails potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 D614G N501Y variant and protect mice\n\nNeutralizing antibodies are important for immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and as therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We identified high-affinity nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and found that nanobody cocktails consisting of two noncompeting nanobodies were able to block ACE2 engagement with RBD variants present in human populations and potently neutralize both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the N501Y D614G variant at low concentrations.

Epitope mapping, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy revealed two distinct antigenic sites and showed two neutralizing nanobodies from different epitope classes bound simultaneously to the spike trimer. Nanobody-Fc fusions of the four most potent nanobodies blocked ACE2 engagement with RBD variants present in human populations and potently neutralized both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the N501Y D614G variant at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. Prophylactic administration of either single nanobody-Fc or as mixtures reduced viral loads by up to 104-fold in mice infected with the N501Y D614G SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Nanobodies have recently attracted extensive attentions due to their excellent biochemical and binding properties. Here, we report two high-affinity nanobodies (Nb-015 and Nb-021) that target non-overlapping epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. Both nanobodies could efficiently neutralize diverse viruses of SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing mechanisms for the two nanobodies are further delineated by high-resolution nanobody/S-RBD complex structures. In addition, an Fc-based tetravalent nanobody format is constructed by combining Nb-015 and Nb-021. The resultant nanobody conjugate, designated as Nb-X2-Fc, exhibits significantly enhanced breadth and potency against all-tested SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sub-lineages. These data demonstrate that Nb-X2-Fc could serve as an effective drug candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, deserving further in-vivo evaluations in the future.\n\nThe pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a severe public health crisis. In view of the wide clinical-applications of antibody drugs, it has always been a research focus to identify new antibodies and/or nanobodies with anti-viral neutralizing activity. In this study, we identified two neutralizing nanobodies (Nb-015 and Nb-021) that target non-overlapping epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with high affinity. Both nanobodies could broadly neutralize diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, we revealed two distinct neutralization mechanisms of Nb-015 and Nb-021 by high-resolution nanobody/S-RBD complex structures. Eventually, we engineered a bispecific nanobody conjugate which exhibits excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, including the original strain and the VOI and VOC variants. We believe that the nanobody conjugate identified in this study could serve as an effective anti-viral drug reserve for potential treatment of COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 17]\n\n[begin paper 18]\n\nPMCID = 9158119\n\nTitle = A Potent Neutralizing Nanobody Targeting the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 and the Structural Basis of Its Intimate Binding\n\nThe continuous spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) around the world has raised unprecedented challenges to the human society. Antibodies and nanobodies possessing neutralization activity represent promising drug candidates. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody that targets the viral spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD). The nanobody, termed as Nb-007, engages SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with the two-digit picomolar binding affinity and shows outstanding virus entry-inhibition activity. The complex structure of Nb-007 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD reveals an epitope that is partially overlapping with the binding site for the human receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The nanobody therefore exerts neutralization by competing with ACE2 for S-RBD binding, which is further ascertained by our in-vitro biochemical analyses. Finally, we also show that Nb-007 reserves promising, though compromised, neutralization activity against the currently-circulating Delta variant and that fusion of the nanobody with Fc dramatically increases its entry-inhibition capacity. Taken together, these data have paved the way of developing Nb-007 as a drug-reserve for potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 related diseases.\n\n[end paper 18]\n\n[begin paper 19]\n\nPMCID = 10251734\n\nTitle = A nanobody recognizes a unique conserved epitope and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) Omicron variant sub-lineages spread rapidly worldwide, mostly due to their immune-evasive properties. This has put a significant part of the population at risk for severe disease and underscores the need for effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents against emergent strains in vulnerable patients. Camelid nanobodies are attractive therapeutic candidates due to their high stability, ease of large-scale production, and potential for delivery via inhalation. Here, we characterize the receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific nanobody W25 and show superior neutralization activity toward Omicron sub-lineages in comparison to all other SARS-CoV2 variants. Structure analysis of W25 in complex with the SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein shows that W25 engages an RBD epitope not covered by any of the antibodies previously approved for emergency use. In\u00a0vivo evaluation of W25 prophylactic and therapeutic treatments across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant infection models, together with W25 biodistribution analysis in mice, demonstrates favorable pre-clinical properties.

The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was functionally restricted to SARS-CoV-2 by accessibility. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Levels of LRRC15 were greatly elevated by inflammatory signals in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence that it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19.\n\nA systematic search for human proteins that can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 reveals that LRRC15 can act as a host factor for the virus, and may therefore modulate infection with potential implications for COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 20]\n\n[begin paper 21]\n\nPMCID = 11140877\n\nTitle = Therapeutic nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic human coronaviruses\n\nNanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from variable domain of camelid or shark heavy-chain antibodies, have unique properties with small size, strong binding affinity, easy construction in versatile formats, high neutralizing activity, protective efficacy, and manufactural capacity on a large-scale.

The lead drug candidate possessing an Fc tag (Nanosota-1C-Fc) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD ~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ~160 times more efficiently than ACE2 did. Administered at a single dose, Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models. Unlike conventional antibodies, Nanosota-1C-Fc was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability.

We analyzed electron microscopy maps of nanobody-spike complexes and quantified the conformational entropy of binding. This informed the design of an engineered nanobody with improved binding to the spike protein. This result offers a guiding principle for the rational maturation of nanobodies directed against the spike. High-binding potency nanobodies have been shown to be effective in animal models; thus, this technology could have application in future pandemics.\n\nCamelid single-domain antibodies, also known as nanobodies, can be readily isolated from na\u00efve libraries for specific targets but often bind too weakly to their targets to be immediately useful.

Using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and a na\u00efve library, we generated closely related nanobodies with micromolar to nanomolar binding affinities. By analyzing the structure\u2013activity relationship using X-ray crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy, and biophysical methods, we observed that higher conformational entropy losses in the formation of the spike protein\u2013nanobody complex are associated with tighter binding. To investigate this, we generated structural ensembles of the different complexes from electron microscopy maps and correlated the conformational fluctuations with binding affinity.

The structure and mechanism of action were investigated by AlphaFold, docking, and residue mutation assays.\n\nWe isolated and characterized a nanobody, Nb-H6, which exhibits a broad affinity for S1 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, or Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37), and Omicron (BA.2 and BA.5), and blocks receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding. Moreover, Nb-H6 can retain its binding capability after pH or thermal treatment and effectively neutralize both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2, as well as VOC Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.2 and BA.5) pseudoviruses. We also confirmed that Nb-H6 binds two distinct amino acid residues of the RBD, preventing SARS-CoV-2 from interacting with the host receptor.\n\nOur study highlights a novel nanobody, Nb-H6, that may be useful therapeutically in SARS-CoV-2 and VOC outbreaks and pandemics. These findings also provide a molecular foundation for further studies into how nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and variants and imply potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 28]\n\n[begin paper 29]\n\nPMCID = 9678391\n\nTitle = Nanobody derived using a peptide epitope from the spike protein receptor-binding motif inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe emergence of new escape mutants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has escalated its penetration among the human population and has reinstated its status as a global pandemic. Therefore, developing effective antiviral therapy against emerging SARS-CoV variants and other viruses in a short period becomes essential. Blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells by disrupting the spike glycoprotein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction has already been exploited for vaccine development and monoclonal antibody therapy. Unlike the previous reports, our study used a nine-amino acid peptide from the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein as an epitope. We report the identification of an efficacious nanobody N1.2 that blocks the entry of pseudovirus-containing SARS-CoV-2 spike as the surface glycoprotein. Moreover, using mCherry fluorescence-based reporter assay, we observe a more potent neutralizing effect against both the hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and the Omicron (BA.1) pseudotyped spike virus with a bivalent version of the N1.2 nanobody. In summary, our study presents a rapid and efficient methodology to use peptide sequences from a protein\u2013receptor interaction interface as epitopes for screening nanobodies against potential pathogenic targets. We propose that this approach can also be widely extended to target other viruses and pathogens in the future.\n\n[end paper 29]\n\n[begin paper 30]\n\nPMCID = 11554226\n\nTitle = Super broad and protective nanobodies against Sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and the divergent SARS-CoV-2 subvariant KP.3.1.1\n\nThe ongoing evolution and immune escape of SARS-CoV-2, alongside the potential threat of SARS-CoV-1 and other sarbecoviruses, underscore the urgent need for effective strategies against their infection and transmission. This study highlights the discovery of nanobodies from immunized alpacas, which demonstrate exceptionally broad and potent neutralizing capabilities against the recently emerged and more divergent SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants including JD.1.1, JN.1, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, as well as SARS-CoV-1 and coronaviruses from bats and pangolins utilizing receptor ACE2. Among these, Tnb04-1 emerges as the most broad and potent, binding to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the spike\u2019s receptor-binding domain, distinct from the ACE2 binding site. This interaction disrupts the formation of a proteinase K-resistant core, crucial for viral-cell fusion. Notably, intranasal administration of Tnb04-1 in Syrian hamsters effectively prevented respiratory infection and transmission of the authentic Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant. Thus, Thb04-1 holds promise in combating respiratory acquisition and transmission of diverse sarbecoviruses.\n\nAs SARS-CoV-2 evolves and evades antibody immunity, new antibody intervention strategies are urgently needed to prevent viral acquisition and transmission. We identified a cluster of nanobodies from immunized alpacas with broad and potent neutralizing activity against all major SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, and ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses from bats and pangolins. Tnb04-1 was the most effective, binding to a conserved epitope in spike and providing strong protection against contact and respiratory infection of Omicron XBB.1.5 in Syrian hamsters. Tnb04-1 shows promise for next-generation antibody interventions against diverse sarbecoviruses.\n\n[end paper 30]\n\n[begin paper 31]\n\nPMCID = 10301551\n\nTitle = Neutralizing and Enhancing Epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) Identified by Nanobodies\n\nEngineered nanobodies (VHs) to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) were generated using phage display technology. A recombinant Wuhan RBD served as bait in phage panning to fish out nanobody-displaying phages from a VH/VHH phage display library. Sixteen phage-infected E. coli clones produced nanobodies with 81.79\u201398.96% framework similarity to human antibodies; thus, they may be regarded as human nanobodies. Nanobodies of E. coli clones 114 and 278 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in a dose-dependent manner; nanobodies of clones 103 and 105 enhanced the virus\u2019s infectivity by increasing the cytopathic effect (CPE) in an infected Vero E6 monolayer. These four nanobodies also bound to recombinant Delta and Omicron RBDs and native SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The neutralizing VH114 epitope contains the previously reported VYAWN motif (Wuhan RBD residues 350\u2013354). The linear epitope of neutralizing VH278 at Wuhan RBD 319RVQPTESIVRFPNITN334 is novel. In this study, for the first time, we report SARS-CoV-2 RBD-enhancing epitopes, i.e., a linear VH103 epitope at RBD residues 359NCVADVSVLYNSAPFFTFKCYG380, and the VH105 epitope, most likely conformational and formed by residues in three RBD regions that are spatially juxtaposed upon the protein folding. Data obtained in this way are useful for the rational design of subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that should be devoid of enhancing epitopes. VH114 and VH278 should be tested further for clinical use against COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 31]\n\n[begin paper 32]\n\nPMCID = 8515575\n\nTitle = Atomistic Simulations and In Silico Mutational Profiling of Protein Stability and Binding in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Complexes with Nanobodies: Molecular Determinants of Mutational Escape Mechanisms\n\nStructure-functional studies have recently revealed a spectrum of diverse high-affinity nanobodies with efficient neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2 virus and resilience against mutational escape. In this study, we combine atomistic simulations with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes with a wide range of nanobodies to identify dynamic and binding affinity fingerprints and characterize the energetic determinants of nanobody-escaping mutations. Using an in silico mutational profiling approach for probing the protein stability and binding, we examine dynamics and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with single nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E + U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of the CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies. This study characterizes the binding energy hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 protein and complexes with nanobodies providing a quantitative analysis of the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations on binding that is consistent with a broad range of biochemical experiments. The results suggest that mutational escape may be controlled through structurally adaptable binding hotspots in the receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant binding epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. This study offers a plausible mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobodies can elicit the increased binding affinity response and yield resilience to common escape mutants.\n\n[end paper 32]\n\n[begin paper 33]\n\nPMCID = 8448731\n\nTitle = A cell-free nanobody engineering platform rapidly generates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies\n\nAntibody engineering technologies face increasing demands for speed, reliability and scale. We develop CeVICA, a cell-free nanobody engineering platform that uses ribosome display for in vitro selection of nanobodies from a library of 1011 randomized sequences. We apply CeVICA to engineer nanobodies against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and identify >800 binder families using a computational pipeline based on CDR-directed clustering. Among 38 experimentally-tested families, 30 are true RBD binders and 11 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus infection. Affinity maturation and multivalency engineering increase nanobody binding affinity and yield a virus neutralizer with picomolar IC50. Furthermore, the capability of CeVICA for comprehensive binder prediction allows us to validate the fitness of our nanobody library. CeVICA offers an integrated solution for rapid generation of divergent synthetic nanobodies with tunable affinities in vitro and may serve as the basis for automated and highly parallel nanobody engineering.\n\nFaster, higher throughput antibody engineering methods are needed.

Previously, we reported on the isolation and in vitro characterization of a potent single-domain nanobody, NIH-CoVnb-112, specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the molecular basis for the observed broad in vitro neutralization capability of NIH-CoVnb-112 against variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. The structure of NIH-CoVnb-112 bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD reveals a large contact surface area overlapping the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site, which is largely unencumbered by the common RBD mutations. In an in vivo pilot study, we demonstrate effective reductions in weight loss, viral burden, and lung pathology in a Syrian hamster model of COVID-19 following nebulized delivery of NIH-CoVnb-112. These findings support the further development of NIH-CoVnb-112 as a potential adjunct preventative therapeutic for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAbbreviations: ACE2 \u2013 angiotensin converting enzyme 2BSA \u2013 buried surface areaCDR \u2013 complementary determining regionRBD \u2013 receptor binding domainRBM \u2013 receptor-binding motifSARS-CoV-2 - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\n[end paper 34]\n\n[begin paper 35]\n\nPMCID = 8420576\n\nTitle = Neutralization of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by highly potent, hyperthermostable, and mutation\u2010tolerant nanobodies\n\nMonoclonal anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 immunoglobulins represent a treatment option for COVID\u201019. However, their production in mammalian cells is not scalable to meet the global demand. Single\u2010domain (VHH) antibodies (also called nanobodies) provide an alternative suitable for microbial production. Using alpaca immune libraries against the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike protein, we isolated 45 infection\u2010blocking VHH antibodies. These include nanobodies that can withstand 95\u00b0C. The most effective VHH antibody neutralizes SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 at 17\u201350\u00a0pM concentration (0.2\u20130.7\u00a0\u00b5g per liter), binds the open and closed states of the Spike, and shows a tight RBD interaction in the X\u2010ray and cryo\u2010EM structures. The best VHH trimers neutralize even at 40\u00a0ng per liter. We constructed nanobody tandems and identified nanobody monomers that tolerate the K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, and L452R immune\u2010escape mutations found in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, and Delta/Kappa lineages. We also demonstrate neutralization of the Beta strain at low\u2010picomolar VHH concentrations. We further discovered VHH antibodies that enforce native folding of the RBD in the E.\u00a0coli cytosol, where its folding normally fails. Such \u201cfold\u2010promoting\u201d nanobodies may allow for simplified production of vaccines and their adaptation to viral escape\u2010mutations.\n\nSingle\u2010domain camelid antibodies that neutralize a range of common and emerging immune\u2010escape mutant strains of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may constitute an easily\u2010producible option for treatment of COVID\u201019 patients.  \n\n[end paper 35]\n\n[begin paper 36]\n\nPMCID = 10695562\n\nTitle = Lys417 acts as a molecular switch that regulates the conformation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n\nSARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a key role in mediating viral entry and inducing host immune responses. It can adopt either an open or closed conformation based on the position of its receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is yet unclear what causes these conformational changes or how they influence the spike\u2019s functions. Here, we show that Lys417 in the RBD plays dual roles in the spike\u2019s structure: it stabilizes the closed conformation of the trimeric spike by mediating inter-spike\u2013subunit interactions; it also directly interacts with ACE2 receptor. Hence, a K417V mutation has opposing effects on the spike\u2019s function: it opens up the spike for better ACE2 binding while weakening the RBD\u2019s direct binding to ACE2. The net outcomes of this mutation are to allow the spike to bind ACE2 with higher probability and mediate viral entry more efficiently, but become more exposed to neutralizing antibodies. Given that residue 417 has been a viral mutational hotspot, SARS-CoV-2 may have been evolving to strike a balance between infection potency and immune evasion, contributing to its pandemic spread.\n\n[end paper 36]\n\n[begin paper 37]\n\nPMCID = 9479348\n\nTitle = A potent synthetic nanobody with broad-spectrum activity neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Omicron variant BA.1 through a unique binding mode\n\nThe major challenge to controlling the COVID pandemic is the rapid mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to the escape of the protection of vaccines and most of the neutralizing antibodies to date. Thus, it is essential to develop neutralizing antibodies with broad-spectrum activity targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we report a synthetic nanobody (named C5G2) obtained by phage display and subsequent antibody engineering. C5G2 has a single-digit nanomolar binding affinity to the RBD domain and inhibits its binding to ACE2 with an IC50 of 3.7\u00a0nM. Pseudovirus assays indicated that monovalent C5G2 could protect the cells from infection with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus and most of the viruses of concern, i.e., Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Omicron variants. Strikingly, C5G2 has the highest potency against Omicron BA.1 among all the variants, with an IC50 of 4.9\u00a0ng/mL. The cryo-EM structure of C5G2 in complex with the spike trimer showed that C5G2 binds to RBD mainly through its CDR3 at a conserved region that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding surface. Additionally, C5G2 binds simultaneously to the neighboring NTD domain of the spike trimer through the same CDR3 loop, which may further increase its potency against viral infection. Third, the steric hindrance caused by FR2 of C5G2 could inhibit the binding of ACE2 to RBD as well. Thus, this triple-function nanobody may serve as an effective drug for prophylaxis and therapy against Omicron as well as future variants.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12951-022-01619-y.\n\n[end paper 37]\n\n[begin paper 38]\n\nPMCID = 10013841\n\nTitle = Cyanovirin-N binds to select SARS-CoV-2 spike oligosaccharides outside of the receptor binding domain and blocks infection by SARS-CoV-2\n\nThe antiviral lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is shown to have potent activity against the syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. CV-N showed improved binding and potency against more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and is shown to be able to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in test animals. The mechanism of action for CV-N is distinct from that of currently used anti-COVID therapeutics or from common vaccine targets on the receptor binding domain. CV-N is a potential broad-spectrum agent against infection from SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus which has caused the recent deadly pandemic called COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virion is coated with a heavily glycosylated Spike glycoprotein which is responsible for attachment and entry into target cells. One, as yet unexploited strategy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, is the targeting of the glycans on Spike. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Some lectins can neutralize enveloped viruses displaying external glycoproteins, offering an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention of infection with virulent \u03b2-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that the cyanobacterial lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) can selectively target SARS-CoV-2 Spike oligosaccharides and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. CV-N neutralizes Delta and Omicron variants in\u00a0vitro better than earlier circulating viral variants. CV-N binds selectively to Spike with a Kd as low as 15 nM and a stoichiometry of 2 CV-N: 1 Spike but does not bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Further mapping of CV-N binding sites on Spike shows that select high-mannose oligosaccharides in the S1 domain of Spike are targeted by CV-N. CV-N also reduced viral loads in the nares and lungs in\u00a0vivo to protect hamsters against a lethal viral challenge. In summary, we present an anti-coronavirus agent that works by an unexploited mechanism and prevents infection by a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 strains.\n\n[end paper 38]\n\n[begin paper 39]\n\nPMCID = 8982573\n\nTitle = Biparatopic sybodies neutralize SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants of concern and mitigate drug resistance\n\nThe ongoing COVID\u201019 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis.

Cryo\u2010EM confirms that Sb#15 and Sb#68 engage two spatially discrete epitopes, influencing rational design of bispecific and tri\u2010bispecific fusion constructs that exhibit up to 100\u2010 and 1,000\u2010fold increase in neutralization potency, respectively. Cryo\u2010EM of the sybody\u2010spike complex additionally reveals a novel up\u2010out RBD conformation. While resistant viruses emerge rapidly in the presence of single binders, no escape variants are observed in the presence of the bispecific sybody.

Here, we describe the development of VHH-IgA1.1, a nanobody IgA fusion molecule as an inhalable, affordable and less invasive prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants. VHH-IgA1.1 recognizes a conserved epitope of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and potently neutralizes major global SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) including the Omicron variant and its sub lineages BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.2.12.1. VHH-IgA1.1 is also much more potent against Omicron variants as compared to an IgG Fc fusion construct, demonstrating the importance of IgA mediated mucosal protection for Omicron infection. Intranasal administration of VHH-IgA1.1 prior to or after challenge conferred significant protection from severe respiratory disease in K18-ACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 VOC. More importantly, for cost-effective production, VHH-IgA1.1 produced in Pichia pastoris had comparable potency to mammalian produced antibodies.

The most effective way to control the pandemic is to rapidly suppress the spread of the virus through early detection using a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use diagnostic platform. In biosensors that use bioprobes, the binding affinity of molecular recognition elements (MREs) is the primary factor determining the dynamic range of the sensing platform. Furthermore, the sensitivity relies mainly on bioprobe quality with sufficient functionality. This comprehensive review investigates aptamers and nanobodies recently developed as advanced MREs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and therapeutic applications. These bioprobes might be integrated into organic bioelectronic materials and devices, with promising enhanced sensitivity and specificity.

Until today, Covid-19, which not only causes life-threatening lung infections but also impairs various other organs and tissues, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused irreparable damage to many others. Since the very onset of the pandemic, huge efforts were made worldwide to fully understand this virus and numerous studies were, and still are, published. Many of these deal with structural analyses of the viral spike glycoprotein and with vaccine development, antibodies and antiviral molecules or immunomodulators that are assumed to become essential tools in the struggle against the virus. This paper summarizes knowledge on the properties of the four structural proteins (spike protein S, membrane protein M, envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its relatives, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that emerged few years earlier. Moreover, attention is paid to ways to analyze such proteins using freely available bioinformatic tools and, more importantly, to bring these proteins alive by looking at them on a computer/laptop screen with the easy-to-use but highly performant and interactive molecular graphics program DeepView. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate non-bioinformaticians and non-specialists in structural biology to scrutinize these and other macromolecules and as such will contribute to establishing procedures to fight these and maybe other forthcoming viruses.\n\n[end paper 42]\n\n[begin paper 43]\n\nPMCID = 8458290\n\nTitle = A potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralising nanobody shows therapeutic efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19\n\nSARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat to human health particularly as escape mutants emerge. There is an unmet need for effective treatments against COVID-19 for which neutralizing single domain antibodies (nanobodies) have significant potential. Their small size and stability mean that nanobodies are compatible with respiratory administration. We report four nanobodies (C5, H3, C1, F2) engineered as homotrimers with pmolar affinity for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Crystal structures show C5 and H3 overlap the ACE2 epitope, whilst C1 and F2 bind to a different epitope. Cryo Electron Microscopy shows C5 binding results in an all down arrangement of the Spike protein. C1, H3 and C5 all neutralize the Victoria strain, and the highly transmissible Alpha (B.1.1.7 first identified in Kent, UK) strain and C1 also neutralizes the Beta (B.1.35, first identified in South Africa). Administration of C5-trimer via the respiratory route showed potent therapeutic efficacy in the Syrian hamster model of COVID-19 and separately, effective prophylaxis. The molecule was similarly potent by intraperitoneal injection.\n\nNeutralizing nanobodies (Nb) are of considerable interest as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the known entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our findings reveal that for a protein to function as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, it needs to satisfy two essential criteria: interaction with the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and close proximity to the cell membrane. Following this rule, RBD-binding SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory proteins, such as neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies, when present on the cell surface, all act as entry receptors. We have applied this knowledge in engineering cell-attachable RBD-binders with significantly improved antiviral activity and for converting cell surface proteins into viral receptors to facilitate virus infection in various virus-based applications.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein to recognize and infect host cells by binding to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is composed of peptidase domain (PD), collectrin-like domain, transmembrane domain, and short cytoplasmic domain, and may exist as a dimer on cell surface. The RBD binding site is located atop of the ACE2 PD, but the involvement of other domains in virus infection is uncertain. We found that the ACE2 PD alone, whether anchored to cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or attached to another surface protein, is fully functional as a receptor for spike-mediated cell fusion and virus infection. However, for ACE2 to function as the viral receptor, the RBD binding site must be positioned in close proximity to the cell membrane. Elevating the surface height of ACE2 using long and rigid protein spacers reduces or eliminates cell fusion and virus infection. Moreover, we found that the RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and de novo designed miniprotein binders, when present on cell surface, also act as viral receptors, facilitating cell fusion and virus infection. Our data demonstrate that RBD binding and close membrane proximity are essential properties for a receptor to effectively mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we show that soluble RBD-binders can be engineered to make cells either susceptible or resistant to virus infection, which has significant implications for antiviral therapy and various virus-mediated applications.\n\n[end paper 44]\n\n[begin paper 45]\n\nPMCID = 11609190\n\nTitle = Research progress of spike protein mutation of SARS-CoV-2 mutant strain and antibody development\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease with a very high infectious rate caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). Because SARS-CoV-2 is easy to mutate, the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains not only enhances the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 but also brings great obstacles to the treatment of COVID-19.

In this report, we built dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) VHH phage libraries for the isolation of high-affinity nanobodies that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cryo-EM complex structures reveal that one dromedary camel VHH nanobody (8A2) binds the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein, and the other (7A3) targets a deeply buried region that uniquely extends to the S2 subunit beyond the S1 subunit. These nanobodies can protect mice from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these nanobodies against COVID-19. The dromedary camel VHH libraries could be helpful to isolate neutralizing nanobodies against future emerging viruses quickly.\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is a trimer of S1/S2 heterodimers with three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) at the S1 subunit for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Due to their small size, nanobodies can recognize protein cavities that are not accessible to conventional antibodies. To isolate high-affinity nanobodies, large libraries with great diversity are highly desirable. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) that are transmitted to humans. Here, we built large dromedary camel VHH phage libraries to isolate nanobodies that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. We isolated two VHH nanobodies, NCI-CoV-7A3 (7A3) and NCI-CoV-8A2 (8A2), which have a high affinity for the RBD via targeting nonoverlapping epitopes and show broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants of concern. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) complex structures revealed that 8A2 binds the RBD in its up mode with a long CDR3 loop directly involved in the ACE2 binding residues and that 7A3 targets a deeply buried region that uniquely extends from the S1 subunit to the apex of the S2 subunit regardless of the conformational state of the RBD. At a dose of \u22655 mg/kg, 7A3 efficiently protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting its therapeutic use against COVID-19 variants. The dromedary camel VHH phage libraries could be helpful as a unique platform ready for quickly isolating potent nanobodies against future emerging viruses.\n\n[end paper 46]\n\n[begin paper 47]\n\nPMCID = 10892724\n\nTitle = SARS-CoV-2 Specific Nanobodies Neutralize Different Variants of Concern and Reduce Virus Load in the Brain of h-ACE2 Transgenic Mice\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant need to develop antivirals and vaccines to combat the disease. In this work, we developed llama-derived nanobodies (Nbs) directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and other domains of the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the Nbs with neutralizing properties were directed to RBD and were able to block S-2P/ACE2 interaction. Three neutralizing Nbs recognized the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-2P protein. Intranasal administration of Nbs induced protection ranging from 40% to 80% after challenge with the WA1/2020 strain in k18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Interestingly, protection was associated with a significant reduction in virus replication in nasal turbinates and a reduction in virus load in the brain. Employing pseudovirus neutralization assays, we identified Nbs with neutralizing capacity against the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants, including a Nb capable of neutralizing all variants tested. Furthermore, cocktails of different Nbs performed better than individual Nbs at neutralizing two Omicron variants (B.1.529 and BA.2). Altogether, the data suggest the potential of SARS-CoV-2 specific Nbs for intranasal treatment of COVID-19 encephalitis.\n\n[end paper 47]\n\n[begin paper 48]\n\nPMCID = 9884143\n\nTitle = Expanding and improving nanobody repertoires using a yeast display method: Targeting SARS-CoV-2\n\nCOVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, represents a serious worldwide health issue, with continually emerging new variants challenging current therapeutics. One promising alternate therapeutic avenue is represented by nanobodies, small single-chain antibodies derived from camelids with numerous advantageous properties and the potential to neutralize the virus. For identification and characterization of a broad spectrum of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 Spike nanobodies, we further optimized a yeast display method, leveraging a previously published mass spectrometry-based method, using B-cell complementary DNA from the same immunized animals as a source of VHH sequences. Yeast display captured many of the sequences identified by the previous approach, as well as many additional sequences that proved to encode a large new repertoire of nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We evaluated DNA shuffling applied to the three complementarity-determining regions of antiviral nanobodies. The results suggested a surprising degree of modularity to complementarity-determining region function. Importantly, the yeast display approach applied to nanobody libraries from immunized animals allows parallel interrogation of a vast number of nanobodies. For example, we employed a modified yeast display to carry out massively parallel epitope binning. The current yeast display approach proved comparable in efficiency and specificity to the mass spectrometry\u2013based approach, while requiring none of the infrastructure and expertise required for that approach, making these highly complementary approaches that together appear to comprehensively explore the paratope space. The larger repertoires produced maximize the likelihood of discovering broadly specific reagents and those that powerfully synergize in mixtures.\n\n[end paper 48]\n\n[begin paper 49]\n\nPMCID = 8853550\n\nTitle = Structural and antigenic variations in the spike protein of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is continuously evolving, and this poses a major threat to antibody therapies and currently authorized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. It is therefore of utmost importance to investigate and predict the putative mutations on the spike protein that confer immune evasion. Antibodies are key components of the human immune system\u2019s response to SARS-CoV-2, and the spike protein is a prime target of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) as it plays critical roles in host cell recognition, fusion, and virus entry. The potency of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines partly depends on how readily the virus can escape neutralization. Recent structural and functional studies have mapped the epitope landscape of nAbs on the spike protein, which illustrates the footprints of several nAbs and the site of escape mutations. In this review, we discuss (1) the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants; (2) the structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and nAb classification; and (3) identification of the RBD escape mutations for several antibodies that resist antibody binding and neutralization. These escape maps are a valuable tool to predict SARS-CoV-2 fitness, and in conjunction with the structures of the spike-nAb complex, they can be utilized to facilitate the rational design of escape-resistant antibody therapeutics and vaccines.\n\n[end paper 49]\n\n[begin paper 50]\n\nPMCID = 8971115\n\nTitle = Circular RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants\n\nAs the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to drive the worldwide pandemic, there is a constant demand for vaccines that offer more effective and broad-spectrum protection.

Notably, the circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than the 1m\u03a8-modified mRNA vaccine and elicited a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and distinct Th1-skewed immune responses. Importantly, we found that the circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron but not the Delta variant. In contrast, the circRNARBD-Delta vaccine protected against both Delta and Omicron or functioned as a booster after two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, making it a favorable choice against the current variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD antigens of SARS-CoV-2 spike provides protection and memory boosting against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, in mice and rhesus macaques.\n\n[end paper 50]\n\n[begin paper 51]\n\nPMCID = 10683510\n\nTitle = Structural understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry to host cells\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major global health concern associated with millions of fatalities worldwide. Mutant variants of the virus have further exacerbated COVID-19 mortality and infection rates, emphasizing the urgent need for effective preventive strategies. Understanding the viral infection mechanism is crucial for developing therapeutics and vaccines. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is a key step in the infection pathway and has been targeted for drug development. Despite numerous reviews of COVID-19 and the virus, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews focusing on the structural aspects of viral entry. In this review, we analyze structural changes in Spike proteins during the entry process, dividing the entry process into prebinding, receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, and membrane fusion steps. By understanding the atomic-scale details of viral entry, we can better target the entry step for intervention strategies. We also examine the impacts of mutations in Spike proteins, including the Omicron variant, on viral entry. Structural information provides insights into the effects of mutations and can guide the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Finally, we discuss available structure-based approaches for the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Overall, this review provides a detailed analysis of the structural aspects of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, highlighting its significance in the development of therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. Therefore, our review emphasizes the importance of structural information in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n[end paper 51]\n\n[begin paper 52]\n\nPMCID = 8724751\n\nTitle = Monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 therapy and SARS-CoV-2 detection\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an exceptional public health crisis that demands the timely creation of new therapeutics and viral detection. Owing to their high specificity and reliability, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful tools to treat and detect numerous diseases. Hence, many researchers have begun to urgently develop Ab-based kits for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Ab drugs for use as COVID-19 therapeutic agents. The detailed structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known, and since this protein is key for viral infection, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) has become a major target for therapeutic Ab development. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a high mutation rate, especially under the selective pressure of aggressively deployed prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing Abs, the use of Ab cocktails is expected to be an important strategy for effective COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection may stimulate an overactive immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm that drives severe disease progression. Abs to combat cytokine storms have also been under intense development as treatments for COVID-19. In addition to their use as drugs, Abs are currently being utilized in SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, including antigen and immunoglobulin tests. Such Ab-based detection tests are crucial surveillance tools that can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

We combine phage display, multivariate enrichment, next-generation sequencing, and a streamlined screening strategy to identify numerous anti\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nanobodies. We characterize their potency and specificity using neutralization assays and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the receptor binding domain (RBD), and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric half-maximal inhibitory concentrations around 13 and 16 ng/ml). Other nanobodies bind to a more conserved epitope on the side of the RBD and are able to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 founder virus (42 ng/ml), the Beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2) (35 ng/ml), and also cross-neutralize the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 (0.46 \u03bcg/ml). The approach presented here is well suited for the screening of phage libraries to identify functional nanobodies for various biomedical and biochemical applications.\n\nHigh-throughput mining of camelid immune repertoires identified broad and potent nanobodies from an immunized alpaca.\n\n[end paper 53]\n\n[begin paper 54]\n\nPMCID = 10268213\n\nTitle = Fully synthetic platform to rapidly generate tetravalent bispecific nanobody\u2013based immunoglobulins\n\nNanobodies are a promising class of biologics that can be used to prevent or treat viral infections. Here, we describe the production and validation of a discovery library that produces single-domain nanobodies using an engineered human antibody variable gene segment. As a test case, anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies were isolated from this library and pairs of complementary nanobodies were incorporated into an antibody-like molecule that targets the receptor-binding domain using a biparatopic mode of engagement. This modular bispecific format enabled the rapid testing of nanobody pairs, and we show that incorporating pairs of nanobodies with different specificities can have synergistic effects on neutralization breadth and potency.\n\nNanobodies bind a target antigen with a kinetic profile similar to a conventional antibody, but exist as a single heavy chain domain that can be readily multimerized to engage antigen via multiple interactions. Presently, most nanobodies are produced by immunizing camelids; however, platforms for animal-free production are growing in popularity. Here, we describe the development of a fully synthetic nanobody library based on an engineered human VH3-23 variable gene and a multispecific antibody-like format designed for biparatopic target engagement. To validate our library, we selected nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor\u2013binding domain and employed an on-yeast epitope binning strategy to rapidly map the specificities of the selected nanobodies. We then generated antibody-like molecules by replacing the VH and VL domains of a conventional antibody with two different nanobodies, designed as a molecular clamp to engage the receptor-binding domain biparatopically. The resulting bispecific tetra-nanobody immunoglobulins neutralized diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants with potencies similar to antibodies isolated from convalescent donors. Subsequent biochemical analyses confirmed the accuracy of the on-yeast epitope binning and structures of both individual nanobodies, and a tetra-nanobody immunoglobulin revealed that the intended mode of interaction had been achieved. This overall workflow is applicable to nearly any protein target and provides a blueprint for a modular workflow for the development of multispecific molecules.\n\n[end paper 54]\n\n[begin paper 55]\n\nPMCID = 10858482\n\nTitle = Computational design and engineering of self-assembling multivalent microproteins with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2\n\nMultivalent drugs targeting homo-oligomeric viral surface proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) protein, have the potential to elicit more potent and broad-spectrum therapeutic responses than monovalent drugs by synergistically engaging multiple binding sites on viral targets. However, rational design and engineering of nanoscale multivalent protein drugs are still lacking. Here, we developed a computational approach to engineer self-assembling trivalent microproteins that simultaneously bind to the three receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the S protein. This approach involves four steps: structure-guided linker design, molecular simulation evaluation of self-assembly, experimental validation of self-assembly state, and functional testing. Using this approach, we first designed trivalent constructs of the microprotein miniACE2 (MP) with different trimerization scaffolds and linkers, and found that one of the constructs (MP-5ff) showed high trimerization efficiency, good conformational homogeneity, and strong antiviral neutralizing activity. With its trimerization unit (5ff), we then engineered a trivalent nanobody (Tr67) that exhibited potent and broad neutralizing activity against the dominant Omicron variants, including XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. Cryo-EM complex structure confirmed that Tr67 stably binds to all three RBDs of the Omicron S protein in a synergistic form,\u00a0locking them in the \u201c3-RBD-up\u201d conformation that could block human receptor (ACE2) binding and potentially facilitate immune clearance. Therefore, our approach provides an effective strategy for engineering potent protein drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronaviruses.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12951-024-02329-3.\n\n[end paper 55]\n\n[begin paper 56]\n\nPMCID = 9900178\n\nTitle = SARS-CoV-2 spike HexaPro formulated in aluminium hydroxide and administered in an accelerated vaccination schedule partially protects Syrian Hamsters against viral challenge despite low neutralizing antibody responses\n\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to human health as new variants emerge and thus a diverse vaccine pipeline is needed. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike protein formulated in Alhydrogel\u00ae (aluminium oxyhydroxide) in Syrian hamsters, using an accelerated two dose regimen (given 10 days apart) and a standard regimen (two doses given 21 days apart). Both regimens elicited spike- and RBD-specific IgG antibody responses of similar magnitude, but in vitro virus neutralization was low or undetectable. Despite this, the accelerated two dose regimen offered reduction in viral load and protected against lung pathology upon challenge with homologous SARS-CoV-2 virus (Wuhan-Hu-1). This highlights that vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease can be obtained despite low neutralizing antibody levels and suggests that accelerated vaccine schedules may be used to confer rapid protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease.\n\n[end paper 56]\n\n[begin paper 57]\n\nPMCID = 8223476\n\nTitle = Directed evolution of potent neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 using CDR-swapping mutagenesis\n\nThere is widespread interest in facile methods for generating potent neutralizing antibodies, nanobodies, and other affinity proteins against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses to address current and future pandemics. While isolating antibodies from animals and humans are proven approaches, these methods are limited to the affinities, specificities, and functional activities of antibodies generated by the immune system. Here we report a surprisingly simple directed evolution method for generating nanobodies with high affinities and neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that complementarity-determining region swapping between low-affinity lead nanobodies, which we discovered unintentionally but find is simple to implement systematically, results in matured nanobodies with unusually large increases in affinity. Importantly, the matured nanobodies potently neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus, and possess drug-like biophysical properties.

In this review, we highlight recent studies that provide atomic-resolution structural details important for the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be used therapeutically and prophylactically and for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Structural studies with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs have revealed a diverse set of binding modes on the spike\u2019s receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain and highlight alternative targets on the spike. We consider this structural work together with mAb effects in vivo to suggest correlations between structure and clinical applications.

As microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration, here we interrogated whether SARS-CoV-2 can promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using SARS-CoV-2 infection of transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a COVID-19 pre-clinical model, we established the presence of virus in the brain together with microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome upregulation in comparison to uninfected mice. Next, utilising a model of human monocyte-derived microglia, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 isolates can bind and enter human microglia in the absence of viral replication. This interaction of virus and microglia directly induced robust inflammasome activation, even in the absence of another priming signal. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that purified SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-primed microglia, in a ACE2-dependent manner. Spike protein also could prime the inflammasome in microglia through NF-\u03baB signalling, allowing for activation through either ATP, nigericin or \u03b1-synuclein. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 and spike protein-mediated microglial inflammasome activation was significantly enhanced in the presence of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils and was entirely ablated by NLRP3-inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2 mice treated orally post-infection with the NLRP3 inhibitory drug MCC950, have significantly reduced microglial inflammasome activation, and increased survival in comparison with untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. These results support a possible mechanism of microglial innate immune activation by SARS-CoV-2, which could explain the increased vulnerability to developing neurological symptoms akin to Parkinson\u2019s disease in COVID-19 infected individuals, and a potential therapeutic avenue for intervention.\n\n[end paper 59]\n\n[begin paper 60]\n\nPMCID = 11211474\n\nTitle = A broad neutralizing nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 engineered from an approved drug\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by Spike glycoprotein binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via its receptor binding domain.

Here we report the discovery of a neutralizing nanobody named VHH60, which was directly produced from an engineering nanobody library based on a commercialized nanobody within a very short period. VHH60 competes with human ACE2 to bind the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein at S351, S470-471and S493-494 as determined by structural analysis, with an affinity of 2.56\u2009nM. It inhibits infections of both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and pseudotyped viruses harboring SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, key mutations or variants at the nanomolar level. Furthermore, VHH60 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation 50-fold better and protected mice from death for twice as long as the control group after SARS-CoV-2 nasal infections in vivo.

For SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein recognizes and binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing viral RNA to enter the host cell.

A broadly-neutralizing coronavirus therapeutic is desirable not only to prevent and treat COVID-19, but also to provide protection for high-risk populations against future emergent coronaviruses. As all coronaviruses use spike proteins on the viral surface to enter the host cells, and these spike proteins share sequence and structural homology, we set out to discover cross-reactive biologic agents targeting the spike protein to block viral entry. Through llama immunization campaigns, we have identified single domain antibodies (VHHs) that are cross-reactive against multiple emergent coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS). Importantly, a number of these antibodies show sub-nanomolar potency towards all SARS-like viruses including emergent CoV-2 variants. We identified nine distinct epitopes on the spike protein targeted by these VHHs. Further, by engineering VHHs targeting distinct, conserved epitopes into multi-valent formats, we significantly enhanced their neutralization potencies compared to the corresponding VHH cocktails. We believe this approach is ideally suited to address both emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants during the current pandemic as well as potential future pandemics caused by SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\n[end paper 67]\n\n[begin paper 68]\n\nPMCID = 11236199\n\nTitle = Variation in structural motifs within SARS-related coronavirus spike proteins\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is the third known coronavirus (CoV) that has crossed the animal-human barrier in the last two decades. However, little structural information exists related to the close genetic species within the SARS-related coronaviruses. Here, we present three novel SARS-related CoV spike protein structures solved by single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis derived from bat (bat SL-CoV WIV1) and civet (cCoV-SZ3, cCoV-007) hosts. We report complex glycan trees that decorate the glycoproteins and density for water molecules which facilitated modeling of the water molecule coordination networks within structurally important regions. We note structural conservation of the fatty acid binding pocket and presence of a linoleic acid molecule which are associated with stabilization of the receptor binding domains in the \u201cdown\u201d conformation. Additionally, the N-terminal biliverdin binding pocket is occupied by a density in all the structures. Finally, we analyzed structural differences in a loop of the receptor binding motif between coronaviruses known to infect humans and the animal coronaviruses described in this study, which regulate binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. This study offers a structural framework to evaluate the close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the ability to inform pandemic prevention, and aid in the development of pan-neutralizing treatments.\n\nSARS-related coronaviruses pose a significant threat to human health and prosperity by virtue of their pandemic potential. Transmission of SARS-related coronaviruses from animals to humans risks another pandemic like the recent COVID-19, or the MERS and SARS outbreaks. To better understand the risk these viruses pose to humans, SARS-related coronaviruses from animal origin should be structurally studied to assess key features related to pathogenicity and stability. The spike proteins from two civet coronaviruses (cCoV-007 and cCoV-SZ3) and a horseshoe bat coronavirus (bCoV-WIV1) were structurally resolved by cryo-electron microscopy and analysed for similarity to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, for which bats and civets have both been implicated as potential hosts. The quality of the reconstructions allowed us to determine important features of the spikes, such as the network of water molecules that coordinate and stabilize the fatty acid in the fatty acid binding pocket, which are typically not visible in glycoprotein reconstructions. We also identified a different conformation of a key loop in the receptor binding domain of these spikes. This loop has previously been identified as being involved in host recognition and receptor binding. This study offers a structural insight into spike protein structural features which promote success in coronaviruses that infect bats and civets, and helps us to better understand what drives the success of these viruses in such a broad host range.\n\n[end paper 68]\n\n[begin paper 69]\n\nPMCID = 8608585\n\nTitle = Anti-SARS-CoV-1 and \u22122 nanobody engineering towards avidity-inspired therapeutics\n\nIn the past two decades, the emergence of coronavirus diseases has been dire distress on both continental and global fronts and has resulted in the search for potent treatment strategies. One crucial challenge in this search is the recurrent mutations in the causative virus spike protein, which lead to viral escape issues. Among the current promising therapeutic discoveries is the use of nanobodies and nanobody-like molecules. While these nanobodies have demonstrated high-affinity interaction with the virus, the unpredictable spike mutations have warranted the need for avidity-inspired therapeutics of potent inhibitors such as nanobodies. This article discusses novel approaches for the design of anti-SARS-CoV-1 and \u22122 nanobodies to facilitate advanced innovations in treatment technologies. It further discusses molecular interactions and suggests multivalent protein nanotechnology and chemistry approaches to translate mere molecular affinity into avidity.\n\n[end paper 69]\n\n[begin paper 70]\n\nPMCID = 9924070\n\nTitle = An affinity-enhanced, broadly neutralizing heavy chain\u2013only antibody protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models\n\nA heavy chain\u2013only antibody drug with broad SARS coronavirus neutralizing activity protects mice and hamsters.\n\nStrategies to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have relied upon neutralization of the virus in vivo. These strategies include treatment with antibodies, recombinant ACE2 molecules, and heavy chain\u2013only antibodies, also known as nanobodies. In this study, Schepens et al. refined and improved the affinity of VHH72, a previously identified camelid-derived heavy chain\u2013only antibody. The authors show that VHH72 neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and binds to a conserved region of the spike protein that would be difficult for larger human antibodies to access.

Antibody-based therapeutics are also essential for pandemic preparedness against future Sarbecovirus outbreaks. Camelid-derived single domain antibodies (VHHs) exhibit potent antimicrobial activity and are being developed as SARS-CoV-2\u2013neutralizing antibody-like therapeutics. Here, we identified VHHs that neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including now circulating variants. We observed that the VHHs bound to a highly conserved epitope in the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein that is difficult to access for human antibodies. Structure-guided molecular modeling, combined with rapid yeast-based prototyping, resulted in an affinity enhanced VHH-human immunoglobulin G1 Fc fusion molecule with subnanomolar neutralizing activity. This VHH-Fc fusion protein, produced in and purified from cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, controlled SARS-CoV-2 replication in prophylactic and therapeutic settings in mice expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Preliminary identification of the binding epitopes of nanobodies by peptide-based ELISA and competition assay. Then four multivalent nanobodies were engineered by attaching the monovalent nanobodies to an antibody-binding nanoplatform constructed based on the lumazine synthase protein cage nanoparticles isolated from the Aquifex aeolicus (AaLS). Finally, the differences in potency between the monovalent and multivalent nanobodies were compared using the same methods.\n\nThree of the four specific nanobodies could maintain substantial inhibitory activity against the Omicron (B.1.1.529), of them, B-B2 had the best neutralizing activity against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) pseudovirus (IC50 = 1.658 \u03bcg/mL). The antiviral ability of multivalent nanobody LS-B-B2 was improved in the Omicron (B.1.1.529) pseudovirus assays (IC50 = 0.653 \u03bcg/mL). The results of peptide-based ELISA indicated that LS-B-B2 might react with the linear epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD conserved regions, which would clarify the mechanisms for the maintenance of potent neutralization of Omicron (B.1.1.529) preliminary.\n\nOur study indicated that the AaLS could be used as an antibody-binding nanoplatform to present nanobodies on its surface and improve the potency of nanobodies.

Here, we present 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs) specific for the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD), of which 8 Nbs potently inhibit the interaction of RBD with angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the major viral docking site. Following detailed epitope mapping and structural analysis, we select two inhibitory Nbs, one of which binds an epitope inside and one of which binds an epitope outside the RBD:ACE2 interface. Based on these, we generate a biparatopic nanobody (bipNb) with viral neutralization efficacy in the picomolar range. Using bipNb as a surrogate, we establish a competitive multiplex binding assay (\u201cNeutrobodyPlex\u201d) for detailed analysis of the presence and performance of neutralizing RBD\u2010binding antibodies in serum of convalescent or vaccinated patients.

With tireless efforts from scientists around the world, understanding of the biology of coronavirus has been greatly enhanced over the past 2 years. Structural biology has demonstrated its powerful impact on uncovering structures and functions for the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and guided the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize current progress in the structural biology of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss important biological issues that remain to be addressed. We present the examples of structure-based design of Pfizer\u2019s novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug PF-07321332 (Paxlovid), Merck\u2019s nucleotide inhibitor molnupiravir (Lagevrio), and VV116, an oral drug candidate for COVID-19.

Nanobodies were selected after the biopanning of two VHH-libraries, one of which was generated after the immunization of a llama (lama glama) with the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus, and another with the full-length pre-fused locked S protein (S-2P) and the RBD from the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain (WT). Most of the neutralizing Nbs selected with either RBD or S-2P from SARS-CoV-2 were directed to RBD and were able to block S-2P/ACE2 interaction. Three Nbs recognized the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-2P protein as measured by competition with biliverdin, while some non-neutralizing Nbs recognize epitopes in the S2 domain. One Nb from the BCoV immune library was directed to RBD but was non-neutralizing. Intranasal administration of Nbs induced protection ranging from 40% to 80% against COVID-19 death in k18-hACE2 mice challenged with the WT strain. Interestingly, protection was not only associated with a significant reduction of virus replication in nasal turbinates and lungs, but also with a reduction of virus load in the brain. Employing pseudovirus neutralization assays, we were able to identify Nbs with neutralizing capacity against the Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, cocktails of different Nbs performed better than individual Nbs to neutralize two Omicron variants (B.1.529 and BA.2). Altogether, the data suggest these Nbs can potentially be used as a cocktail for intranasal treatment to prevent or treat COVID-19 encephalitis, or modified for prophylactic administration to fight this disease.\n\n[end paper 74]\n\n[begin paper 75]\n\nPMCID = 8908544\n\nTitle = Structural basis of nanobodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nBecause of the evolutionary variants of SARS-CoV-2, development of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies resilient to virus escape is urgently needed. We identified a group of high-affinity nanobodies from camels immunized with receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and resolved the structures of two non-competing nanobodies (NB1A7 and NB1B11) in complex with RBD using X-ray crystallography. The structures show that NB1A7 targets the highly conserved cryptic epitope shared by SARS-CoV-2 variants and some other coronaviruses and blocks ACE2 receptor attachment of the spike protein, and NB1B11 epitope overlaps with the contacting surface of ACE2 and is different from the binding site of NB1A7. These two nanobodies were covalently linked into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats, which significantly improved the avidity and neutralization potency and may further inhibit viral escape. The results contribute to the structure-guided design of antibodies against future variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus to combat coronavirus epidemics and pandemics.\n\nShi et\u00a0al. identify two neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Nanobodies with nanometer-scale size are promising for the detection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants because they are superior to conventional antibodies in terms of cryptic epitope accessibility, tissue penetration, cost, formatting adaptability, and especially protein stability, which enables their aerosolized specific delivery to lung tissues. This review summarizes the progress in the prevention, detection, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 using nanobodies, as well as strategies to combat the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In the USA alone, over 5,482,602 people are currently infected, and more than 171,823 people have died. SARS-CoV-2 has shown a higher infectivity rate and a more extended incubation period as compared to previous coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 binds much more strongly than SARS-CoV to the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Previously, several methods to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV have been tried with limited success. Since SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) protein for entry to the host cell, it is one of the most preferred targets for making vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

Vaccines in combination with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 carry great hope in the treatment and final elimination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the relentless emergence of variants of concern (VOC), including the most recent Omicron variants, presses for novel measures to counter these variants that often show immune evasion. Hereby we developed a targeted photodynamic approach to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by engineering a genetically encoded photosensitizer (SOPP3) to a diverse list of antibodies targeting the wild-type (WT) spike protein, including human antibodies isolated from a 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient, potent monomeric and multimeric nanobodies targeting receptor-binding domain (RBD), and non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs) targeting the more conserved N-terminal domain (NTD). As confirmed by pseudovirus neutralization assay, this targeted photodynamic approach significantly increased the efficacy of these antibodies, especially that of non-NAbs, against not only the WT but also the Delta strain and the heavily immune escape Omicron strain (BA.1). Subsequent measurement of infrared phosphorescence at 1270\u00a0nm confirmed the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in the photodynamic process. Mass spectroscopy assay uncovered amino acids in the spike protein targeted by 1O2.

In an in vivo pilot study, we demonstrate effective reductions in weight loss, viral burden, and lung pathology in a Syrian hamster model of COVID-19 following nebulized delivery of NIH-CoVnb-112.

Multiple pharmaceutical therapies or biologics envision stopping the virus from spreading further; however, WHO has voiced concerns about the variants of concern (VoCs) inability to respond. Nanobodies are a new class of antibody mimics with binding affinity and specificity similar to classical mAbs, as well as the privileges of a small molecular weight, ease of entry into solid tissues, and binding cryptic epitopes of the antigen. Herein, we investigated multiple putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies targeting the Receptor binding domain of the WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using a comprehensive\u00a0computational immunoinformatics methodology. With affinity maturation via alanine scanning mutagenesis, we remodeled an ultrapotent nanobody with substantial breadth and potency, exhibiting pico-molar binding affinities against all the VoCs. An antiviral peptide with specificity for ACE-2 receptors was affixed to make it multispecific and discourage viral entry. Collectively, we constructed a broad-spectrum therapeutic biparatopic nanobody-peptide conjugate (NPC) extending coverage to SARS-CoV-2 VoCs RBDs. We PEGylated the biparatopic construct with 20kD maleimide-terminated PEG (MAL-(PEG)n-OMe) to improve its clinical efficacy limiting rapid renal clearance, and performed in silico cloning to facilitate future experimental studies.

Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, are promising therapeutic tools against pandemic viruses due to their favorable properties. In this study, we identified a novel nanobody, Nanosota-9, which demonstrates high potency against a wide range of Omicron subvariants both in vitro and in a mouse model. Cryo-EM data revealed that Nanosota-9 neutralizes Omicron through a unique mechanism: two Nanosota-9 molecules crosslink two receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the trimeric Omicron spike protein, preventing the RBDs from binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mechanism explains its strong anti-Omicron potency. Additionally, the Nanosota-9 binding epitopes on the spike protein are relatively conserved among Omicron subvariants, contributing to its broad anti-Omicron spectrum. Combined with our recently developed structure-guided in vitro evolution approach for nanobodies, Nanosota-9 has the potential to serve as the foundation for a superior anti-Omicron therapeutic.\n\nOmicron continues to evolve and spread among humans, making the development of effective and broad-spectrum treatments a top priority for global health. Nanobodies, which are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, show great promise due to their small size and ability to target conserved, hidden regions on the virus. In this study, we identified a novel nanobody called Nanosota-9, which effectively inhibits most major Omicron subvariants. Our cryo-EM analysis revealed a unique structural mechanism by which Nanosota-9 neutralizes Omicron. Like many other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and nanobodies, Nanosota-9 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Omicron spike proteins, blocking receptor binding. However, unlike others, two Nanosota-9 molecules crosslink two RBDs of the trimeric spike, enhancing its anti-Omicron potency. One of the two binding sites on the RBD that Nanosota-9 targets significantly overlaps with the receptor-binding site and is relatively conserved, while the other site is fully conserved, expanding its anti-Omicron spectrum. Conventional antibodies cannot access the same binding sites on the spike protein as Nanosota-9, highlighting its unique neutralization mechanism. Combined with our newly developed structure-guided in vitro evolution approach for nanobodies, Nanosota-9 has strong potential as a superior anti-Omicron therapeutic.\n\n[end paper 84]\n\n[begin paper 85]\n\nPMCID = 7430568\n\nTitle = An ultra-potent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by locking Spike into an inactive conformation\n\nWithout an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.\n\n[end paper 85]\n\n[begin paper 86]\n\nPMCID = 9967551\n\nTitle = Distinct Conformations of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Spike Protein and Its Interaction with ACE2 and Antibody\n\nSince November 2021, Omicron has been the dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has continuously impacted human health. Omicron sublineages are still increasing and cause increased transmission and infection rates. The additional 15 mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron spike proteins change the protein conformation, enabling the Omicron variant to evade neutralizing antibodies. For this reason, many efforts have been made to design new antigenic variants to induce effective antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. However, understanding the different states of Omicron spike proteins with and without external molecules has not yet been addressed. In this review, we analyze the structures of the spike protein in the presence and absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and antibodies. Compared to previously determined structures for the wildtype spike protein and other variants such as alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, the Omicron spike protein adopts a partially open form. The open-form spike protein with one RBD up is dominant, followed by the open-form spike protein with two RBD up, and the closed-form spike protein with the RBD down. It is suggested that the competition between antibodies and ACE2 induces interactions between adjacent RBDs of the spike protein, which lead to a partially open form of the Omicron spike protein. The comprehensive structural information of Omicron spike proteins could be helpful for the efficient design of vaccines against the Omicron variant.\n\n[end paper 86]\n\n[begin paper 87]\n\nPMCID = 8646660\n\nTitle = Uncovering a conserved vulnerability site in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by a human antibody\n\nAn essential step for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is the attachment to the host cell receptor by its Spike receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD). Most of the existing RBD\u2010targeting neutralizing antibodies block the receptor\u2010binding motif (RBM), a mutable region with the potential to generate neutralization escape mutants. Here, we isolated and structurally characterized a non\u2010RBM\u2010targeting monoclonal antibody (FD20) from convalescent patients. FD20 engages the RBD at an epitope distal to the RBM with a K D of 5.6\u2009nM, neutralizes SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 including the current Variants of Concern such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 (Delta), displays modest cross\u2010reactivity against SARS\u2010CoV, and reduces viral replication in hamsters. The epitope coincides with a predicted \u201cideal\u201d vulnerability site with high functional and structural constraints. Mutation of the residues of the conserved epitope variably affects FD20\u2010binding but confers little or no resistance to neutralization. Finally, in\u2009vitro mode\u2010of\u2010action characterization and negative\u2010stain electron microscopy suggest a neutralization mechanism by which FD20 destructs the Spike. Our results reveal a conserved vulnerability site in the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike for the development of potential antiviral drugs.\n\nA monoclonal antibody (FD20) from convalescent COVID\u201019 patients has been isolated and structurally and biologically characterized. Various SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 strains, including the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, and naturally occurring epitope mutants, can be neutralized by FD20 with similar potency. \n\n[end paper 87]\n\n[begin paper 88]\n\nPMCID = 7822889\n\nTitle = A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses\n\nThere is need for effective and affordable vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a protein nanoparticle vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the display of coronavirus spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a synthetic virus-like particle (VLP) platform, SpyCatcher003-mi3, using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induce a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that is superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluate antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we show that RBD-SpyVLP induces a polyclonal antibody response that recognises key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence. The data suggests that RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVaccines for SARS-COV-2 are needed in the ongoing pandemic. Here the authors characterize a vaccine candidate that presents the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on a synthetic VLP platform using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology and show immunogenicity of a prime-boost regimen in mice and pigs.\n\n[end paper 88]\n\n[begin paper 89]\n\nPMCID = 10294592\n\nTitle = Potent and broad neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by DARPins\n\nWe report the engineering and selection of two synthetic proteins \u2013 FSR16m and FSR22 \u2013 for possible treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. FSR16m and FSR22 are trimeric proteins composed of DARPin SR16m or SR22 fused with a T4 foldon. Despite selection by a spike protein from a now historical SARS-CoV-2 strain, FSR16m and FSR22 exhibit broad spectrum neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 strains, inhibiting authentic B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and BA.1.1 viruses, with respective IC50 values of 3.4, 2.2 and 7.4 ng/mL for FSR16m. Cryo-EM structures revealed that these DARPins recognize a region of the receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 455\u2013456, 486\u2013489) overlapping a critical portion of the ACE2-binding surface. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with B.1.617.2 and receiving intranasally-administered FSR16m showed less weight loss and 10\u2013100-fold lower viral burden in upper and lower respiratory tracts. The strong and broad neutralization potency make FSR16m and FSR22 promising candidates for prevention and treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2.\n\n[end paper 89]\n\n[begin paper 90]\n\nPMCID = 9016159\n\nTitle = Advances in Pathogenesis, Progression, Potential Targets and Targeted Therapeutic Strategies in SARS-CoV-2-Induced COVID-19\n\nAs the new year of 2020 approaches, an acute respiratory disease quietly caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, COVID-19 broke out on a global scale and formed a global public health emergency. To date, the destruction that has lasted for more than two years has not stopped and has caused the virus to continuously evolve new mutant strains. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to cause multiple complications and lead to severe disability and death, which has dealt a heavy blow to global development, not only in the medical field but also in social security, economic development, global cooperation and communication. To date, studies on the epidemiology, pathogenic mechanism and pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19, as well as target confirmation, drug screening, and clinical intervention have achieved remarkable effects. With the continuous efforts of the WHO, governments of various countries, and scientific research and medical personnel, the public\u2019s awareness of COVID-19 is gradually deepening, a variety of prevention methods and detection methods have been implemented, and multiple vaccines and drugs have been developed and urgently marketed. However, these do not appear to have completely stopped the pandemic and ravages of this virus. Meanwhile, research on SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 has also seen some twists and controversies, such as potential drugs and the role of vaccines. In view of the fact that research on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been extensive and in depth, this review will systematically update the current understanding of the epidemiology, transmission mechanism, pathological features, potential targets, promising drugs and ongoing clinical trials, which will provide important references and new directions for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.\n\n[end paper 90]\n\n[begin paper 91]\n\nPMCID = 11054741\n\nTitle = Engineered Multivalent Nanobodies Efficiently Neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Subvariants BA.1, BA.4/5, XBB.1 and BQ.1.1\n\nMost available neutralizing antibodies are ineffective against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Therefore, it is crucial to develop potent and broad-spectrum alternatives to effectively manage Omicron subvariants. Here, we constructed a high-diversity nanobody phage display library and identified nine nanobodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Five of them exhibited cross-neutralization activity against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) strain and the Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.4/5, and one nanobody demonstrated marked efficacy even against the Omicron subvariants BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. To enhance the therapeutic potential, we engineered a panel of multivalent nanobodies with increased neutralizing potency and breadth. The most potent multivalent nanobody, B13-B13-B13, cross-neutralized all tested pseudoviruses, with a geometric mean of the 50% inhibitory concentration (GM IC50) value of 20.83 ng/mL. An analysis of the mechanism underlying the enhancement of neutralization breadth by representative multivalent nanobodies demonstrated that the strategic engineering approach of combining two or three nanobodies into a multivalent molecule could improve the affinity between a single nanobody and spike, and could enhance tolerance toward escape mutations such as R346T and N460K. Our engineered multivalent nanobodies may be promising drug candidates for treating and preventing infection with Omicron subvariants and even future variants.\n\n[end paper 91]\n\n[begin paper 92]\n\nPMCID = 9258422\n\nTitle = Multivalent designed proteins neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and confer protection against infection in mice\n\nNew variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to arise and prolong the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here we used a cell-free expression workflow to rapidly screen and optimize constructs containing multiple computationally designed miniprotein inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. We found the broadest efficacy with a homo-trimeric version of the 75-residue angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mimic AHB2 (TRI2\u20132) designed to geometrically match the trimeric spike architecture. In the cryo-electron microscopy structure, TRI2 formed a tripod on top of the spike protein which engaged all three receptor binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously as in the design model. TRI2\u20132 neutralized Omicron (B.1.1.529), Delta (B.1.617.2), and all other variants tested with greater potency than that of monoclonal antibodies used clinically for the treatment of COVID-19. TRI2\u20132 also conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge when administered intranasally in mice. Designed miniprotein receptor mimics geometrically arrayed to match pathogen receptor binding sites could be a widely applicable antiviral therapeutic strategy with advantages over antibodies and native receptor traps. By comparison, the designed proteins have resistance to viral escape and antigenic drift by construction, precisely tuned avidity, and greatly reduced chance of autoimmune responses.\n\nComputationally designed trivalent minibinders provide therapeutic protection in mice against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.\n\n[end paper 92]\n\n[begin paper 93]\n\nPMCID = 10303109\n\nTitle = Structure-Guided Development of Bivalent Aptamers Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Infection\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused devastation to human society through its high virulence, infectivity, and genomic mutations, which reduced the efficacy of vaccines. Here, we report the development of aptamers that effectively interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting its spike protein, which plays a pivotal role in host cell entry of the virus through interaction with the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To develop highly effective aptamers and to understand their mechanism in inhibiting viral infection, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structures of aptamer/receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Moreover, we developed bivalent aptamers targeting two distinct regions of the RBD in the spike protein that directly interact with ACE2. One aptamer interferes with the binding of ACE2 by blocking the ACE2-binding site in RBD, and the other aptamer allosterically inhibits ACE2 by binding to a distinct face of RBD. Using the 3D structures of aptamer\u2013RBD complexes, we minimized and optimized these aptamers. By combining the optimized aptamers, we developed a bivalent aptamer that showed a stronger inhibitory effect on virus infection than the component aptamers. This study confirms that the structure-based aptamer-design approach has a high potential in developing antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.\n\n[end paper 93]\n\n[begin paper 94]\n\nPMCID = 7857409\n\nTitle = An ultrapotent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by stabilizing inactive Spike\n\nMonoclonal antibodies that bind to the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) show therapeutic promise but must be produced in mammalian cells and need to be delivered intravenously. By contrast, single-domain antibodies called nanobodies can be produced in bacteria or yeast, and their stability may enable aerosol delivery. Two papers now report nanobodies that bind tightly to spike and efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cells. Schoof et al. screened a yeast surface display of synthetic nanobodies and Xiang et al. screened anti-spike nanobodies produced by a llama. Both groups identified highly potent nanobodies that lock the spike protein in an inactive conformation. Multivalent constructs of selected nanobodies achieved even more potent neutralization.\n\nScience, this issue p. 1473, p. \n\nPotent neutralizers of SARS-CoV-2 are identified by screening either synthetic or llama-produced nanobodies.\n\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains locked into their inaccessible down state, incapable of binding ACE2.

SARS-CoV-2 has an exceptionally high level of transmissibility and extremely broad tissue tropism. However, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for sustaining this degree of virulence remains largely unexplored. In this article, we review the current knowledge and crucial information about how SARS-CoV-2 attaches on the surface of host cells through a variety of receptors, such as ACE2, neuropilin-1, AXL, and antibody\u2013Fc\u03b3R complexes. We further explain how its spike (S) protein undergoes conformational transition from prefusion to postfusion with the help of proteases like furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins. We then review the ongoing experimental studies and clinical trials of antibodies, peptides, or small-molecule compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and discuss how these antiviral therapies targeting host\u2013pathogen interaction could potentially suppress viral attachment, reduce the exposure of fusion peptide to curtail membrane fusion and block the formation of six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core. Finally, the specter of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants deserves a serious review of broad-spectrum drugs or vaccines for long-term prevention and control of COVID-19 in the future.\n\n[end paper 95]\n\n[begin paper 96]\n\nPMCID = 9082315\n\nTitle = Nanobodies Protecting From Lethal SARS-CoV-2 Infection Target Receptor Binding Epitopes Preserved in Virus Variants Other Than Omicron\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape from immune neutralization are challenging vaccines and antibodies developed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it is important to establish therapeutics directed toward multiple or specific SARS-CoV-2 variants. The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the key target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs). We selected a panel of nine nanobodies (Nbs) from dromedary camels immunized with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S, and engineered Nb fusions as humanized heavy chain Abs (hcAbs). Nbs and derived hcAbs bound with subnanomolar or picomolar affinities to the S and its RBD, and S-binding cross-competition clustered them in two different groups. Most of the hcAbs hindered RBD binding to its human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor, blocked cell entry of viruses pseudotyped with the S protein and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell cultures. Four potent neutralizing hcAbs prevented the progression to lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2-transgenic mice, demonstrating their therapeutic potential. Cryo-electron microscopy identified Nb binding epitopes in and out the receptor binding motif (RBM), and showed different ways to prevent virus binding to its cell entry receptor. The Nb binding modes were consistent with its recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants; mono and bispecific hcAbs efficiently bound all variants of concern except omicron, which emphasized the immune escape capacity of this latest variant.\n\n[end paper 96]\n\n[begin paper 97]\n\nPMCID = 7844813\n\nTitle = Development of multivalent nanobodies blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting RBD of spike protein\n\nThe outbreak and pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused significant threaten to global public health and economic consequences. It is extremely urgent that global people must take actions to develop safe and effective preventions and therapeutics. Nanobodies, which are derived from single\u2011chain camelid antibodies, had shown antiviral properties in various challenge viruses. In this study, multivalent nanobodies with high affinity blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction with ACE2 protein were developed.\n\nTotally, four specific nanobodies against spike protein and its RBD domain were screened from a na\u00efve VHH library. Among them, Nb91-hFc and Nb3-hFc demonstrated antiviral activity by neutralizing spike pseudotyped viruses in vitro. Subsequently, multivalent nanobodies were constructed to improve the neutralizing capacity. As a result, heterodimer nanobody Nb91-Nb3-hFc exhibited the strongest RBD-binding affinity and neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with an IC50 value at approximately 1.54\u00a0nM.\n\nThe present study indicated that na\u00efve VHH library could be used as a potential resource for rapid acquisition and exploitation of antiviral nanobodies. Heterodimer nanobody Nb91-Nb3-hFc may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 97]\n\n[begin paper 98]\n\nPMCID = 8828845\n\nTitle = An ultrapotent RBD-targeted biparatopic nanobody neutralizes broad SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe wide transmission and host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid accumulation of mutations, posing significant challenges to the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Although several neutralizing antibodies were authorized for emergency clinical use, convalescent patients derived natural antibodies are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation. Here, we describe the screen of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted nanobodies (Nbs) from a synthetic library and the design of a biparatopic Nb, named Nb1\u2013Nb2, with tight affinity and super-wide neutralization breadth against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Deep-mutational scanning experiments identify the potential binding epitopes of the Nbs on the RBD and demonstrate that biparatopic Nb1\u2013Nb2 has a strong escape-resistant feature against more than 60 tested RBD amino acid substitutions. Using pseudovirion-based and trans-complementation SARS-CoV-2 tools, we determine that the Nb1\u2013Nb2 broadly neutralizes multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants at sub-nanomolar levels, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37), Kappa (B.1.617.1), and Mu (B.1.621). Furthermore, a heavy-chain antibody is constructed by fusing the human IgG1 Fc to Nb1\u2013Nb2 (designated as Nb1\u2013Nb2-Fc) to improve its neutralization potency, yield, stability, and potential half-life extension. For the new Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) that harbors unprecedented multiple RBD mutations, Nb1\u2013Nb2-Fc keeps a firm affinity (KD\u2009<\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221212\u2009M) and strong neutralizing activity (IC50\u2009=\u20091.46\u2009nM for authentic Omicron virus). Together, we developed a tetravalent biparatopic human heavy-chain antibody with ultrapotent and broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity which highlights the potential clinical applications.\n\n[end paper 98]\n\n[begin paper 99]\n\nPMCID = 10028217\n\nTitle = Efficient virus detection utilizing chitin-immobilized nanobodies synthesized in Ustilago maydis\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the global economy and health care systems, illustrating the urgent need for timely and inexpensive responses to pandemic threats in the form of vaccines and antigen tests. Currently, antigen testing is mostly conducted by qualitative flow chromatography or via quantitative ELISA-type assays. The latter mostly utilize materials like protein-adhesive polymers and gold or latex particles. Here we present an alternative ELISA approach using inexpensive, biogenic materials and permitting quick detection based on components produced in the microbial model Ustilago maydis. In this fungus, heterologous proteins like biopharmaceuticals can be exported by fusion to unconventionally secreted chitinase Cts1. As a unique feature, the carrier chitinase binds to chitin allowing its additional use as a purification or immobilization tag. Recent work has demonstrated that nanobodies are suitable target proteins. These proteins represent a very versatile alternative antibody format and can quickly be adapted to detect novel antigens by camelidae immunization or synthetic libraries. In this study, we exemplarily produced different mono- and bivalent SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies directed against the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as Cts1 fusions and screened their antigen binding affinity in vitro and in vivo. Functional nanobody-Cts1 fusions were immobilized on chitin forming an RBD tethering surface. This provides a solid base for future development of inexpensive antigen tests utilizing unconventionally secreted nanobodies as antigen trap and a matching ubiquitous and biogenic surface for immobilization.\n\n[end paper 99]\n\n[begin paper 100]\n\nPMCID = 10148623\n\nTitle = Perturbation of the host cell Ca2+ homeostasis and ER-mitochondria contact sites by the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins E and M\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The clinical phenotypes are variable, ranging from spontaneous recovery to serious illness and death. On March 2020, a global COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the \u03b2-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate. Here, we focused our attention on the study of SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins, and we found a general perturbation of the host cell calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and a selective rearrangement of the interorganelle contact sites. In vitro and in vivo biochemical analyses revealed that the binding of specific nanobodies to soluble regions of SARS-CoV-2 E protein reversed the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the E protein might be an important therapeutic candidate not only for vaccine development, but also for the clinical management of COVID designing drug regimens that, so far, are very limited.\n\n[end paper 100]\n\n"
