Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic \"Rosetta\" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on Rosetta to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on Rosetta. Include both queries about Rosetta generally as well as queries about how Rosetta relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on Rosetta (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nComputational Biologist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "message": "To effectively gather relevant literature on Rosetta and its application in designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2, I would structure the search queries to cover both general information about Rosetta and its specific applications in nanobody design. Here are the queries I would perform:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"Rosetta software protein design\",\n    \"Rosetta nanobody design SARS-CoV-2\",\n    \"Rosetta spike protein binding prediction\",\n    \"Machine learning Rosetta nanobody optimization\",\n    \"Rosetta computational antibody design SARS-CoV-2\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of how Rosetta can be utilized for protein design, specifically focusing on its application in developing nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. They will help in understanding both the general capabilities of Rosetta and its specific use cases in the context of SARS-CoV-2."
