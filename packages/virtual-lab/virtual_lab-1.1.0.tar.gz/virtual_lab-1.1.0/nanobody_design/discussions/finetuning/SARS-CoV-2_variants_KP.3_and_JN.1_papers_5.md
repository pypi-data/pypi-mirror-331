This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Immunologist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic "SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please use PubMed Central and search for relevant papers on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 using the query "machine learning in designing nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2 variants" and request 100 articles with abstracts only. Read all of the abstracts and based on each abstract individually, decide whether you want to fine-tune yourself on the full text of that paper. Include as many papers as possible, but only include papers that are directly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1. Please provide the PMCIDs and titles of all the papers that you wish to fine-tune yourself on as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as a double-quoted string.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?

Immunologist, please provide your response to the agenda.

It appears that there are currently no articles available on PubMed Central specifically addressing the use of machine learning in designing nanobodies for the SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1. This could be due to the novelty of these variants or the specificity of the query.

Given this situation, I recommend broadening the search criteria to include more general terms related to SARS-CoV-2 nanobody design and machine learning applications. This might help in identifying relevant methodologies or approaches that could be adapted for these specific variants.

If you have any other specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
