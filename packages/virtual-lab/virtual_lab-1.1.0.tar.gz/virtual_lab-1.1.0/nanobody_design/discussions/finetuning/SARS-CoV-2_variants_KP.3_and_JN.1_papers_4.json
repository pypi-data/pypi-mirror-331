        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Immunologist to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nYou are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic \"SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1\" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please use PubMed Central and search for relevant papers on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 using the query \"nanobody cross-reactivity SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 JN.1\" and request 100 articles with abstracts only. Read all of the abstracts and based on each abstract individually, decide whether you want to fine-tune yourself on the full text of that paper. Include as many papers as possible, but only include papers that are directly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1. Please provide the PMCIDs and titles of all the papers that you wish to fine-tune yourself on as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as a double-quoted string.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the PMCIDs and titles of the papers you wish to fine-tune yourself on (as a Python dictionary mapping PMCID as a double-quoted string to title as double-quoted string)?\n\nImmunologist, please provide your response to the agenda."

To induce antibodies against conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions for protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and zoonotic sarbecoviruses, we developed mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles presenting eight sarbecovirus RBDs arranged randomly on a 60-mer nanoparticle. Mosaic-8b immunizations protected animals from challenges from viruses whose RBDs were matched or mismatched to those on nanoparticles. Here, we describe neutralizing mAbs from mosaic-8b\u2013immunized rabbits, some on par with Pemgarda (the only currently FDA-approved therapeutic mAb). Deep mutational scanning, in vitro selection of spike resistance mutations, and cryo-EM structures of spike-antibody complexes demonstrated targeting of conserved epitopes. Rabbit mAbs included critical D-gene segment features in common with human anti-RBD mAbs, despite rabbit genomes lacking an equivalent human D-gene segment. Thus, mosaic RBD-nanoparticle immunization coupled with multiplexed screening represent an efficient way to generate and select therapeutic pan-sarbecovirus and pan-SARS-2 variant mAbs.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n"
