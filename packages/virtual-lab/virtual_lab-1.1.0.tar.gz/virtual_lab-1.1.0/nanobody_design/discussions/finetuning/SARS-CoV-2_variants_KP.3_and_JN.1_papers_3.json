This study highlights the discovery of nanobodies from immunized alpacas, which demonstrate exceptionally broad and potent neutralizing capabilities against the recently emerged and more divergent SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants including JD.1.1, JN.1, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, as well as SARS-CoV-1 and coronaviruses from bats and pangolins utilizing receptor ACE2. Among these, Tnb04-1 emerges as the most broad and potent, binding to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the spike\u2019s receptor-binding domain, distinct from the ACE2 binding site. This interaction disrupts the formation of a proteinase K-resistant core, crucial for viral-cell fusion. Notably, intranasal administration of Tnb04-1 in Syrian hamsters effectively prevented respiratory infection and transmission of the authentic Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant. Thus, Thb04-1 holds promise in combating respiratory acquisition and transmission of diverse sarbecoviruses.\n\nAs SARS-CoV-2 evolves and evades antibody immunity, new antibody intervention strategies are urgently needed to prevent viral acquisition and transmission. We identified a cluster of nanobodies from immunized alpacas with broad and potent neutralizing activity against all major SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, and ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses from bats and pangolins. Tnb04-1 was the most effective, binding to a conserved epitope in spike and providing strong protection against contact and respiratory infection of Omicron XBB.1.5 in Syrian hamsters. Tnb04-1 shows promise for next-generation antibody interventions against diverse sarbecoviruses.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 11609190\n\nTitle = Research progress of spike protein mutation of SARS-CoV-2 mutant strain and antibody development\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease with a very high infectious rate caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). Because SARS-CoV-2 is easy to mutate, the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains not only enhances the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 but also brings great obstacles to the treatment of COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies have achieved good results in the clinical application of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, which can be used for pre-infection protection and treatment of novel coronavirus patients. This review makes a detailed introduction to the mutation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the molecular mechanism of mutation affecting the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and the impact of mutation on monoclonal antibody therapy, providing scientific reference for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains and the research and development of antibody drugs.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 11630572\n\nTitle = Discovery of Nanosota-9 as anti-Omicron nanobody therapeutic candidate\n\nOmicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to pose a significant global health threat. Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, are promising therapeutic tools against pandemic viruses due to their favorable properties. In this study, we identified a novel nanobody, Nanosota-9, which demonstrates high potency against a wide range of Omicron subvariants both in vitro and in a mouse model. Cryo-EM data revealed that Nanosota-9 neutralizes Omicron through a unique mechanism: two Nanosota-9 molecules crosslink two receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the trimeric Omicron spike protein, preventing the RBDs from binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mechanism explains its strong anti-Omicron potency. Additionally, the Nanosota-9 binding epitopes on the spike protein are relatively conserved among Omicron subvariants, contributing to its broad anti-Omicron spectrum. Combined with our recently developed structure-guided in vitro evolution approach for nanobodies, Nanosota-9 has the potential to serve as the foundation for a superior anti-Omicron therapeutic.\n\nOmicron continues to evolve and spread among humans, making the development of effective and broad-spectrum treatments a top priority for global health. Nanobodies, which are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, show great promise due to their small size and ability to target conserved, hidden regions on the virus. In this study, we identified a novel nanobody called Nanosota-9, which effectively inhibits most major Omicron subvariants. Our cryo-EM analysis revealed a unique structural mechanism by which Nanosota-9 neutralizes Omicron. Like many other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and nanobodies, Nanosota-9 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Omicron spike proteins, blocking receptor binding. However, unlike others, two Nanosota-9 molecules crosslink two RBDs of the trimeric spike, enhancing its anti-Omicron potency. One of the two binding sites on the RBD that Nanosota-9 targets significantly overlaps with the receptor-binding site and is relatively conserved, while the other site is fully conserved, expanding its anti-Omicron spectrum. Conventional antibodies cannot access the same binding sites on the spike protein as Nanosota-9, highlighting its unique neutralization mechanism. Combined with our newly developed structure-guided in vitro evolution approach for nanobodies, Nanosota-9 has strong potential as a superior anti-Omicron therapeutic.\n\n[end paper 3]\n\n[begin paper 4]\n\nPMCID = 11722225\n\nTitle = Cross-reactive sarbecovirus antibodies induced by mosaic RBD-nanoparticles\n\nTherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 become obsolete as spike substitutions reduce antibody binding. To induce antibodies against conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions for protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and zoonotic sarbecoviruses, we developed mosaic-8b RBD-nanoparticles presenting eight sarbecovirus RBDs arranged randomly on a 60-mer nanoparticle. Mosaic-8b immunizations protected animals from challenges from viruses whose RBDs were matched or mismatched to those on nanoparticles. Here, we describe neutralizing mAbs from mosaic-8b\u2013immunized rabbits, some on par with Pemgarda (the only currently FDA-approved therapeutic mAb). Deep mutational scanning, in vitro selection of spike resistance mutations, and cryo-EM structures of spike-antibody complexes demonstrated targeting of conserved epitopes. Rabbit mAbs included critical D-gene segment features in common with human anti-RBD mAbs, despite rabbit genomes lacking an equivalent human D-gene segment. Thus, mosaic RBD-nanoparticle immunization coupled with multiplexed screening represent an efficient way to generate and select therapeutic pan-sarbecovirus and pan-SARS-2 variant mAbs.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n"
