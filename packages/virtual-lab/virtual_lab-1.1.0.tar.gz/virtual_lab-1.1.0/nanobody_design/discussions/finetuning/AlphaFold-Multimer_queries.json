Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic \"AlphaFold-Multimer\" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on AlphaFold-Multimer to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on AlphaFold-Multimer. Include both queries about AlphaFold-Multimer generally as well as queries about how AlphaFold-Multimer relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on AlphaFold-Multimer (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nComputational Biologist, please provide your response to the agenda."

To gather relevant scientific literature on AlphaFold-Multimer and its application in designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2, I would perform the following search queries. These queries are designed to cover both general information about AlphaFold-Multimer and its specific application in nanobody design for SARS-CoV-2:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"AlphaFold-Multimer protein structure prediction\",\n    \"AlphaFold-Multimer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\",\n    \"AlphaFold-Multimer nanobody design\",\n    \"AlphaFold-Multimer SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders\",\n    \"machine learning nanobody design SARS-CoV-2\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries should help in identifying key papers and resources that discuss the capabilities of AlphaFold-Multimer in predicting multimeric protein structures, its application to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and its role in the design of nanobody binders."
