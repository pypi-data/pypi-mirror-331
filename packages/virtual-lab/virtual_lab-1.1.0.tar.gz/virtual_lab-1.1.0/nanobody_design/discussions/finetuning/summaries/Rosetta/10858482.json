    "summary": "The paper titled \"Computational design and engineering of self-assembling multivalent microproteins with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2\" presents a novel computational approach to design multivalent protein drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The study focuses on engineering trivalent microproteins that can bind simultaneously to the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the spike protein, enhancing their neutralizing activity against the virus.\n\n### Key Insights on \"Rosetta\" in Designing SARS-CoV-2 Nanobody Binders:\n\n1. **Role of RosettaRemodel**: \n   - RosettaRemodel was employed to design linkers connecting the C-terminus of miniACE2 and the N-terminus of the trimerization scaffold. This tool samples backbone conformations by incorporating fragments from a database of known protein structures, guided by Ramachandran restraints and clash avoidance.\n   - The blueprint file in RosettaRemodel specified the connectivity, secondary structure, and sequence of the linker regions. The \"0\u00d7L\" entries allowed backbone flexibility for fragment insertion, and the linker sequence was specified to match the desired connectivity.\n\n2. **Linker Design and Optimization**:\n   - The study tested (GGGGS)n and (EAAAK)n linkers with varying repeat numbers (n = 2, 3, 4, and 5) to determine optimal structures. The \"-no_jumps\" flag was used to control the folding process within the linker, enabling sampling of degrees of freedom in the connecting region.\n   - For each linker candidate, 1000 independent trajectories were sampled, and the lowest-energy models were saved as PDB files. This process helped identify linkers that provided the necessary geometric matching for effective trimerization.\n\n3. **Computational Evaluation**:\n   - The initial 3D structures of the trivalent constructs were modeled using SWISS-MODEL, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS with the AMBER 99SB-ILDN force field.\n   - Free energy landscapes (FELs) were constructed to map possible conformations and energy levels, using principal component analysis (PCA) to project simulated conformations onto principal components.\n\n4. **Binding Free Energy Calculations**:\n   - The gmx_MMPBSA package was used to calculate the binding free energy of the monomers of the trivalent proteins via the MM/GBSA method. This helped rank the self-assembly abilities of different constructs.\n\n5. **Experimental Validation**:\n   - The designed constructs were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells and purified for experimental validation. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Native-PAGE analyses were used to evaluate their oligomeric states and conformational homogeneity.\n\n6. **Cryo-EM Structural Analysis**:\n   - The cryo-EM structure of the Tr67-Omicron BA.1 spike complex confirmed that Tr67 binds to all three RBDs of the spike protein in a synergistic manner, inducing the \"3-RBD-up\" conformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe study demonstrates the effectiveness of using computational tools like RosettaRemodel in the rational design of multivalent protein drugs. By optimizing linkers and trimerization scaffolds, the researchers successfully engineered trivalent microproteins with enhanced binding affinities and neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants. The approach provides a framework for designing multivalent therapeutics targeting other disease proteins, offering a promising strategy for combating rapidly evolving viruses like SARS-CoV-2.",
