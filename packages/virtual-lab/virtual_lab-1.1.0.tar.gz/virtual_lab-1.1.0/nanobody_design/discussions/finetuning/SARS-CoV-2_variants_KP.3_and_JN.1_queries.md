This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Immunologist to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic "SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1. Include both queries about SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 generally as well as queries about how SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1 (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?

Immunologist, please provide your response to the agenda.

Certainly! To effectively gather relevant scientific literature on SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 and JN.1, especially in the context of designing nanobody binders, here are five distinct search queries you can use:

```python
queries = [
    "SARS-CoV-2 variant KP.3 spike protein structure",
    "SARS-CoV-2 variant JN.1 spike protein structure",
    "nanobody design for SARS-CoV-2 KP.3 variant",
    "nanobody cross-reactivity SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3 JN.1",
    "machine learning in designing nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2 variants"
]
```

These queries are designed to help you gather comprehensive information on the structural characteristics of the KP.3 and JN.1 variants, which is crucial for understanding how to modify nanobodies for improved binding. Additionally, they focus on the application of machine learning in antibody design, which is central to your research project.
