Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. You are responsible for understanding the topic \"nanobodies\" in the context of designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. You need to fine-tune yourself on the relevant literature on nanobodies to improve your ability to design SARS-CoV-2 nanobody binders. Please write out a series of five distinct search queries that you want to run to find relevant scientific papers on nanobodies. Include both queries about nanobodies generally as well as queries about how nanobodies relates to designing nanobody binders for SARS-CoV-2. Please provide the queries in Python syntax as a list of double-quoted strings.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What are the queries that you want to perform to identify the relevant literature on nanobodies (as a list of double-quoted strings in Python syntax)?\n\nImmunologist, please provide your response to the agenda."

These queries are designed to cover both general aspects of nanobodies and their specific application in targeting SARS-CoV-2 variants:\n\n```python\nqueries = [\n    \"nanobodies AND SARS-CoV-2 AND spike protein\",\n    \"nanobody engineering AND cross-reactivity AND viral variants\",\n    \"machine learning AND nanobody design AND SARS-CoV-2\",\n    \"nanobody affinity maturation AND SARS-CoV-2\",\n    \"broadly neutralizing nanobodies AND coronavirus\"\n]\n```\n\nThese queries should help you find comprehensive literature on the development, engineering, and application of nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2, including insights into improving binding affinity and cross-reactivity with various viral variants."
