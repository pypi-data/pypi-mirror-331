Title = Nanobody engineering for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and detection

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for coronavirus inhibitors has inspired research on a variety of small proteins beyond conventional antibodies, including robust single-domain antibody fragments, i.e., “nanobodies.” Here, we explore the potential of nanobody engineering in the development of antivirals and diagnostic tools. Through fusion of nanobody domains that target distinct binding sites, we engineered multimodular nanobody constructs that neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Delta variants at high potency, with IC50 values as low as 50 pM. Despite simultaneous binding to distinct epitopes, Beta and Omicron variants were more resistant to neutralization by the multimodular nanobodies, which highlights the importance of accounting for antigenic drift in the design of biologics. To further explore the applications of nanobody engineering in outbreak management, we present an assay based on fusions of nanobodies with fragments of NanoLuc luciferase that can detect sub-nanomolar quantities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a single step. Our work showcases the potential of nanobody engineering to combat emerging infectious diseases.

Nanobodies, small protein binders derived from the camelid antibody, are highly potent inhibitors of respiratory viruses that offer several advantages over conventional antibodies as candidates for specific therapies, including high stability and low production costs. In this work, we leverage the unique properties of nanobodies and apply them as building blocks for new therapeutic and diagnostic tools. We report ultra-potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by engineered nanobodies comprising multiple modules in structure-guided combinations and develop nanobodies that carry signal molecules, allowing rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results highlight the potential of engineered nanobodies in the development of effective countermeasures, both therapeutic and diagnostic, to manage outbreaks of emerging viruses.

Title = Outlook of therapeutic and diagnostic competency of nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2: A systematic review

The newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect humans, and no completely efficient treatment has yet been found. Antibody therapy is one way to control infection caused by COVID-19, but the use of classical antibodies has many disadvantages. Heavy chain antibodies (HCAbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from the Camelidae family. The variable part of these antibodies (Nanobodies or VHH) has interesting properties such as small size, identify criptic epitopes, stability in harsh conditions, good tissue permeability and cost-effective production causing nanobodies have become a good candidate in the treatment and diagnosis of viral infections.

Totally 157 records (up to November 10, 2021), were recognized to be reviewed in this study. 62 studies were removed after first step screening due to their deviation from inclusion criteria. The remaining 95 studies were reviewed in details. After removing articles that were not in the study area, 45 remaining studies met the inclusion criteria and were qualified to be included in the systematic review.

In this systematic review, the application of nanobodies in the treatment and detection of COVID-19 infection was reviewed. The results of this study showed that extensive and sufficient studies have been performed in the field of production of nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus and the obtained nanobodies have a great potential for use in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

According to the obtained results, it was found that nanobodies can be used effectively in the treatment and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Title =  In vitro generated antibodies guide thermostable ADDomer nanoparticle design for nasal vaccination and passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2

Due to COVID-19, pandemic preparedness emerges as a key imperative, necessitating new approaches to accelerate development of reagents against infectious pathogens.

Here, we developed an integrated approach combining synthetic, computational and structural methods with in vitro antibody selection and in vivo immunization to design, produce and validate nature-inspired nanoparticle-based reagents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Our approach resulted in two innovations: (i) a thermostable nasal vaccine called ADDoCoV, displaying multiple copies of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif derived epitope and (ii) a multivalent nanoparticle superbinder, called Gigabody, against SARS-CoV-2 including immune-evasive variants of concern (VOCs). In vitro generated neutralizing nanobodies and electron cryo-microscopy established authenticity and accessibility of epitopes displayed by ADDoCoV. Gigabody comprising multimerized nanobodies prevented SARS-CoV-2 virion attachment with picomolar EC50. Vaccinating mice resulted in antibodies cross-reacting with VOCs including Delta and Omicron.

Our study elucidates Adenovirus-derived dodecamer (ADDomer)-based nanoparticles for use in active and passive immunization and provides a blueprint for crafting reagents to combat respiratory viral infections.

Statement of Significance: COVID-19 reminds us of the critical importance of pandemic preparedness, requiring sophisticated approaches to facilitate and accelerate reagent development against emerging threats. We described an integrated pipeline approach to rapidly craft in parallel ADDomer-based nanoparticles for vaccination and for passive immunization, applicable to many infectious diseases.

Title = Prospects of Neutralizing Nanobodies Against SARS-CoV-2

Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has erupted on a large scale worldwide and spread rapidly. Passive immunization of antibody-related molecules provides opportunities for prevention and treatment of high-risk patients and children. Nanobodies (Nbs) have many strong physical and chemical properties. They can be atomized, administered by inhalation, and can be directly applied to the infected site, with fast onset, high local drug concentration/high bioavailability, and high patient compliance (no needles). It has very attractive potential in the treatment of respiratory viruses. Rapid and low-cost development of Nbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 can quickly be achieved. Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains also can be utilized quickly to prevent the virus from escaping. It provides important technical supports for the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to become an essential medicine in the toolbox against the SARS-CoV-2.

Title = An ultra-potent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by locking Spike into an inactive conformation

Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.

Title = Neutralization of SARS‐CoV‐2 by highly potent, hyperthermostable, and mutation‐tolerant nanobodies

Monoclonal anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunoglobulins represent a treatment option for COVID‐19. However, their production in mammalian cells is not scalable to meet the global demand. Single‐domain (VHH) antibodies (also called nanobodies) provide an alternative suitable for microbial production. Using alpaca immune libraries against the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein, we isolated 45 infection‐blocking VHH antibodies. These include nanobodies that can withstand 95°C. The most effective VHH antibody neutralizes SARS‐CoV‐2 at 17–50 pM concentration (0.2–0.7 µg per liter), binds the open and closed states of the Spike, and shows a tight RBD interaction in the X‐ray and cryo‐EM structures. The best VHH trimers neutralize even at 40 ng per liter. We constructed nanobody tandems and identified nanobody monomers that tolerate the K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, and L452R immune‐escape mutations found in the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, and Delta/Kappa lineages. We also demonstrate neutralization of the Beta strain at low‐picomolar VHH concentrations. We further discovered VHH antibodies that enforce native folding of the RBD in the E. coli cytosol, where its folding normally fails. Such “fold‐promoting” nanobodies may allow for simplified production of vaccines and their adaptation to viral escape‐mutations.

Single‐domain camelid antibodies that neutralize a range of common and emerging immune‐escape mutant strains of SARS‐CoV‐2 may constitute an easily‐producible option for treatment of COVID‐19 patients.

Title = The short isoform of the host antiviral protein ZAP acts as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a fundamental gene expression event in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It allows production of essential viral, structural and replicative enzymes that are encoded in an alternative reading frame. Despite the importance of PRF for the viral life cycle, it is still largely unknown how and to what extent cellular factors alter mechanical properties of frameshift elements and thereby impact virulence. This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element and the host proteome. We reveal that the short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and inhibits viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA element. Together, these data identify ZAP-S as a host-encoded inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and expand our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation.

Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) occurs in many viruses including SARS-CoV-2 to allow the translation of multiple proteins from a single transcript. Here, the authors identify the human short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) as a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 that severely impairs SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting in cells and directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA; interfering with the folding of the frameshift RNA element.

Title = A SARS-CoV-2 Nanobody Displayed on the Surface of Human Ferritin with High Neutralization Activity

COVID-19 is rampant throughout the world, which has caused great damage to human lives and seriously hindered the development of the global economy. Aiming at the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, in this study, we proposed a novel fenobody strategy based on ferritin (Fe) self-assembly technology.

The neutralizing nanobody H11-D4 of SARS-CoV-2 fused to the C-terminus of end-modified human ferritin was expressed in E. coli and silkworm baculovirus expression systems. A large number of nanoparticles were successfully self-assembled in silkworms, while relatively few nanoparticles can be observed in the treated products from E. coli by electron microscopy. Subsequently, the fenobody’s expression level and neutralizing activity were then evaluated.

The results showed that the IC50 of H11-D4 and fenobody Fe-H11-D4 expressed in E. coli were 171.1 nmol L−1 and 20.87 nmol L−1, respectively. However, the IC50 of Fe-HD11-D4 expressed in silkworms was 1.46 nmol L−1 showing better neutralization activity.

Therefore, fenobodies can be well self-assembled in silkworm baculovirus expression system, and ferritin self-assembly technology can effectively improve nanobody neutralization activity.

Title = Structural Basis for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Recognition by Single-Domain Antibodies

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is the most severe public health event of the twenty-first century. While effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, there remains an urgent need for diagnostics to quickly and accurately detect infections. Antigen tests, particularly those that detect the abundant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, are a proven method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of three llama-derived single-domain antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein with high affinity. Each antibody recognizes a specific folded domain of the protein, with two antibodies recognizing the N-terminal RNA binding domain and one recognizing the C-terminal dimerization domain. The two antibodies that recognize the RNA binding domain affect both RNA binding affinity and RNA-mediated phase separation of the Nucleocapsid protein. All three antibodies recognize highly conserved surfaces on the Nucleocapsid protein, suggesting that they could be used to develop affordable diagnostic tests to detect all circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Title = Potent Therapeutic Strategies for COVID-19 with Single-Domain Antibody Immunoliposomes Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and Lip/cGAMP Enhancing Protective Immunity

The worldwide spread of COVID-19 continues to impact our lives and has led to unprecedented damage to global health and the economy. This highlights the need for an efficient approach to rapidly develop therapeutics and prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2. We modified a single-domain antibody, SARS-CoV-2 VHH, to the surface of the liposomes. These immunoliposomes demonstrated a good neutralizing ability, but could also carry therapeutic compounds. Furthermore, we used the 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 protein as an antigen with Lip/cGAMP as the adjuvant to immunize mice. Lip/cGAMP enhanced the immunity well. It was demonstrated that the combination of RBD-SD1 and Lip/cGAMP was an effective preventive vaccine. This work presented potent therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and an effective vaccine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Title = Nanobody derived using a peptide epitope from the spike protein receptor-binding motif inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 variants

The emergence of new escape mutants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has escalated its penetration among the human population and has reinstated its status as a global pandemic. Therefore, developing effective antiviral therapy against emerging SARS-CoV variants and other viruses in a short period becomes essential. Blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells by disrupting the spike glycoprotein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction has already been exploited for vaccine development and monoclonal antibody therapy. Unlike the previous reports, our study used a nine-amino acid peptide from the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein as an epitope. We report the identification of an efficacious nanobody N1.2 that blocks the entry of pseudovirus-containing SARS-CoV-2 spike as the surface glycoprotein. Moreover, using mCherry fluorescence-based reporter assay, we observe a more potent neutralizing effect against both the hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and the Omicron (BA.1) pseudotyped spike virus with a bivalent version of the N1.2 nanobody. In summary, our study presents a rapid and efficient methodology to use peptide sequences from a protein–receptor interaction interface as epitopes for screening nanobodies against potential pathogenic targets. We propose that this approach can also be widely extended to target other viruses and pathogens in the future.

Title = A Novel Fusion Protein System for the Production of Nanobodies and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD in a Bacterial System

Antibodies are key proteins of the immune system, and they are widely used for both research and theragnostic applications. Among them, camelid immunoglobulins (IgG) differ from the canonical human IgG molecules, as their light chains are completely missing; thus, they have only variable domains on their heavy chains (VHHs). A single VHH domain, often called a nanobody, has favorable structural, biophysical, and functional features compared to canonical antibodies. Therefore, robust and efficient production protocols relying on recombinant technologies are in high demand. Here, by utilizing ecotin, an Escherichia coli protein, as a fusion partner, we present a bacterial expression system that allows an easy, fast, and cost-effective way to prepare nanobodies. Ecotin was used here as a periplasmic translocator and a passive refolding chaperone, which allowed us to reach high-yield production of nanobodies. We also present a new, easily applicable prokaryotic expression and purification method of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for interaction assays. We demonstrate using ECD spectroscopy that the bacterially produced RBD is well-folded. The bacterially produced nanobody was shown to bind strongly to the recombinant RBD, with a Kd of 10 nM. The simple methods presented here could facilitate rapid interaction measurements in the event of the appearance of additional SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Title = Research progress of spike protein mutation of SARS-CoV-2 mutant strain and antibody development

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease with a very high infectious rate caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). Because SARS-CoV-2 is easy to mutate, the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains not only enhances the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 but also brings great obstacles to the treatment of COVID-19. Neutralizing antibodies have achieved good results in the clinical application of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, which can be used for pre-infection protection and treatment of novel coronavirus patients. This review makes a detailed introduction to the mutation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the molecular mechanism of mutation affecting the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and the impact of mutation on monoclonal antibody therapy, providing scientific reference for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains and the research and development of antibody drugs.

Title = Dromedary camel nanobodies broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants

Due to their small size, nanobodies can recognize protein cavities that are not accessible to conventional antibodies. In this report, we built dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) VHH phage libraries for the isolation of high-affinity nanobodies that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cryo-EM complex structures reveal that one dromedary camel VHH nanobody (8A2) binds the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein, and the other (7A3) targets a deeply buried region that uniquely extends to the S2 subunit beyond the S1 subunit. These nanobodies can protect mice from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these nanobodies against COVID-19. The dromedary camel VHH libraries could be helpful to isolate neutralizing nanobodies against future emerging viruses quickly.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is a trimer of S1/S2 heterodimers with three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) at the S1 subunit for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Due to their small size, nanobodies can recognize protein cavities that are not accessible to conventional antibodies. To isolate high-affinity nanobodies, large libraries with great diversity are highly desirable. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) that are transmitted to humans. Here, we built large dromedary camel VHH phage libraries to isolate nanobodies that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. We isolated two VHH nanobodies, NCI-CoV-7A3 (7A3) and NCI-CoV-8A2 (8A2), which have a high affinity for the RBD via targeting nonoverlapping epitopes and show broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants of concern. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) complex structures revealed that 8A2 binds the RBD in its up mode with a long CDR3 loop directly involved in the ACE2 binding residues and that 7A3 targets a deeply buried region that uniquely extends from the S1 subunit to the apex of the S2 subunit regardless of the conformational state of the RBD. At a dose of ≥5 mg/kg, 7A3 efficiently protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from the lethal challenge of variants B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, suggesting its therapeutic use against COVID-19 variants. The dromedary camel VHH phage libraries could be helpful as a unique platform ready for quickly isolating potent nanobodies against future emerging viruses.

Title = Structural and energetic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibody recognition and the impact of circulating variants

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for a detailed molecular understanding of protective antibody responses. This is underscored by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), some of which appear to be less effectively targeted by current monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies, using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures, we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering. We also identified the energetic and conservation features of epitope residues and assessed the capacity of viral variant mutations to disrupt antibody recognition, revealing sets of antibodies predicted to effectively target recently described viral variants. This detailed structure-based reference of antibody RBD recognition signatures can inform therapeutic and vaccine design strategies.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade antibodies induced by vaccines and natural infection, highlights the need for assessment of key molecular and structural features of immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using a large nonredundant set of structures of monoclonal antibodies in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain, we performed analysis of molecular determinants of antibody recognition of the spike glycoprotein, mapping key residues through analysis of atomic contacts and computational modeling to identify molecular hotspots. Clustering was used to identify four major groups of antibodies based on target residues, and we compared epitope conservation and impact of SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations, showing that certain sets of antibodies predicted to be affected by those variants, while others are capable of targeting escape variants. This analysis can serve as a useful reference for vaccine and immunotherapeutic studies, and we provide updated classifications of antibodies to the research community on our CoV3D site.

Title = Computational design and engineering of self-assembling multivalent microproteins with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2

Multivalent drugs targeting homo-oligomeric viral surface proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) protein, have the potential to elicit more potent and broad-spectrum therapeutic responses than monovalent drugs by synergistically engaging multiple binding sites on viral targets. However, rational design and engineering of nanoscale multivalent protein drugs are still lacking. Here, we developed a computational approach to engineer self-assembling trivalent microproteins that simultaneously bind to the three receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the S protein. This approach involves four steps: structure-guided linker design, molecular simulation evaluation of self-assembly, experimental validation of self-assembly state, and functional testing. Using this approach, we first designed trivalent constructs of the microprotein miniACE2 (MP) with different trimerization scaffolds and linkers, and found that one of the constructs (MP-5ff) showed high trimerization efficiency, good conformational homogeneity, and strong antiviral neutralizing activity. With its trimerization unit (5ff), we then engineered a trivalent nanobody (Tr67) that exhibited potent and broad neutralizing activity against the dominant Omicron variants, including XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. Cryo-EM complex structure confirmed that Tr67 stably binds to all three RBDs of the Omicron S protein in a synergistic form, locking them in the “3-RBD-up” conformation that could block human receptor (ACE2) binding and potentially facilitate immune clearance. Therefore, our approach provides an effective strategy for engineering potent protein drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronaviruses.

Title = SARS-CoV-2 detection using a nanobody-functionalized voltammetric device

An ongoing need during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the requirement for accurate and efficient point-of-care testing platforms to distinguish infected from non-infected people, and to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infections from other viruses. Electrochemical platforms can detect the virus via its envelope spike protein by recording changes in voltammetric signals between samples. However, this remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of these sensing platforms.

Here, we report on a nanobody-functionalized electrochemical platform for the rapid detection of whole SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in complex media such as saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples. The sensor relies on the functionalization of gold electrode surface with highly-oriented Llama nanobodies specific to the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The device provides results in 10 min of exposure to 200 µL of unprocessed samples with high specificity to SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in human saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples.

The developed sensor could discriminate between different human coronavirus strains and other respiratory viruses, with 90% positive and 90% negative percentage agreement on 80 clinical samples, as compared to RT-qPCR.

We believe this diagnostic concept, also validated for RBD mutants and successfully tested on Delta variant samples, to be a powerful tool to detect patients’ infection status, easily extendable to other viruses and capable of overcoming sensing-related mutation effects.

Our ability to control SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, relies on access to rapid and sensitive technologies that can detect the virus, and differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infections from infections with other viruses. One potential approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 is to use sensors comprising specific surfaces and chemicals that can detect changes in the properties of samples containing the virus. Here, we develop one of these sensors and test it in samples from people with COVID-19 or other viral infections, or people without. We show that our portable device can quickly and accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 and can also detect different variants. We also show that signals from our device are specific for SARS-CoV-2. Our device may provide another tool for COVID-19 diagnosis, with benefits being portability and speed compared with current gold-standard approaches.

Pagneux et al. developed a nanobody-functionalized electrochemical platform with smartphone readout to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. They demonstrated that their device can rapidly and accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples and discriminate between this virus and other respiratory viruses.

Title = A computationally designed ACE2 decoy has broad efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants and related viruses in vitro and in vivo

SARS-CoV-2, especially B.1.1.529/omicron and its sublineages, continues to mutate to evade monoclonal antibodies and antibodies elicited by vaccination. Affinity-enhanced soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is an alternative strategy that works by binding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, acting as a ‘decoy’ to block the interaction between the S and human ACE2. Using a computational design strategy, we designed an affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoy, FLIF, that exhibited tight binding to SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron variants. Our computationally calculated absolute binding free energies (ABFE) between sACE2:SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and their variants showed excellent agreement to binding experiments. FLIF displayed robust therapeutic utility against a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses, and neutralized omicron BA.5 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we directly compared the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of wild-type ACE2 (non-affinity enhanced ACE2) against FLIF. A few wild-type sACE2 decoys have shown to be effective against early circulating variants such as Wuhan in vivo. Our data suggest that moving forward, affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoys like FLIF may be required to combat evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. The approach described herein emphasizes how computational methods have become sufficiently accurate for the design of therapeutics against viral protein targets. Affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoys remain highly effective at neutralizing omicron subvariants.

A computational design strategy is used to develop an affinity-enhanced ACE2 decoy, which is shown to be effective at neutralizing omicron subvariants in vitro and in vivo.

Each antibody recognizes a specific folded domain of the protein, with two antibodies recognizing the N-terminal RNA binding domain and one recognizing the C-terminal dimerization domain. The two antibodies that recognize the RNA binding domain affect both RNA binding affinity and RNA-mediated phase separation of the Nucleocapsid protein. All three antibodies recognize highly-conserved surfaces on the Nucleocapsid protein, suggesting that they could be used to develop affordable diagnostic tests to detect all circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Title = Nanobody screening and machine learning guided identification of cross-variant anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing heavy-chain only antibodies

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to persist, demonstrating the risks posed by emerging infectious diseases to national security, public health, and the economy. Development of new vaccines and antibodies for emerging viral threats requires substantial resources and time, and traditional development platforms for vaccines and antibodies are often too slow to combat continuously evolving immunological escape variants, reducing their efficacy over time. Previously, we designed a next-generation synthetic humanized nanobody (Nb) phage display library and demonstrated that this library could be used to rapidly identify highly specific and potent neutralizing heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) with prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo against the original SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used a combination of high throughput screening and machine learning (ML) models to identify HCAbs with potent efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants of interest (VOIs) and concern (VOCs). To start, we screened our highly diverse Nb phage display library against several pre-Omicron VOI and VOC receptor binding domains (RBDs) to identify panels of cross-reactive HCAbs. Using HCAb affinity for SARS-CoV-2 VOI and VOCs (pre-Omicron variants) and model features from other published data, we were able to develop a ML model that successfully identified HCAbs with efficacy against Omicron variants, independent of our experimental biopanning workflow. This biopanning informed ML approach reduced the experimental screening burden by 78% to 90% for the Omicron BA.5 and Omicron BA.1 variants, respectively. The combined approach can be applied to other emerging viruses with pandemic potential to rapidly identify effective therapeutic antibodies against emerging variants.

We leveraged a robust experimental pipeline for heavy chain-only (HCAb) library screening to identify 59 potent HCAbs that can cross-neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Several of these HCAbs with efficacy against different variants also bind to different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, suggesting they could be used in antibody cocktails or be engineered as bispecific antibodies that are cross-variant and resistant to viral escape. Using existing published data and data generated from our library of HCAbs against diverse pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants, we developed an ML model to rapidly predict which HCAbs would be effective against Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5. Using this ML model three HCAbs with efficacy against Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 were identified without requiring additional biopanning. This integrated computational and experimental pipeline can be leveraged for future outbreaks to rapidly identify cross-variant countermeasures that are effective against potential emerging variants.

Title = Femtomolar detection of SARS-CoV-2 via peptide beacons integrated on a miniaturized TIRF microscope

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) continues to pose a substantial global health threat. Along with vaccines and targeted therapeutics, there is a critical need for rapid diagnostic solutions. In this work, we use computational protein modeling tools to suggest molecular beacon architectures that function as conformational switches for high-sensitivity detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD). Integrating these beacons on a miniaturized total internal reflection fluorescence (mini-TIRF) microscope, we detect the S-RBD and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with limits of detection in the femtomolar range. We envision that our designed mini-TIRF platform will serve as a robust platform for point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent viral threats.

Computationally validated peptide beacons integrated on mini-TIRF microscopes detect SARS-CoV-2 with femtomolar sensitivity.

Title = Efficient virus detection utilizing chitin-immobilized nanobodies synthesized in Ustilago maydis

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the global economy and health care systems, illustrating the urgent need for timely and inexpensive responses to pandemic threats in the form of vaccines and antigen tests. Currently, antigen testing is mostly conducted by qualitative flow chromatography or via quantitative ELISA-type assays. The latter mostly utilize materials like protein-adhesive polymers and gold or latex particles. Here we present an alternative ELISA approach using inexpensive, biogenic materials and permitting quick detection based on components produced in the microbial model Ustilago maydis. In this fungus, heterologous proteins like biopharmaceuticals can be exported by fusion to unconventionally secreted chitinase Cts1. As a unique feature, the carrier chitinase binds to chitin allowing its additional use as a purification or immobilization tag. Recent work has demonstrated that nanobodies are suitable target proteins. These proteins represent a very versatile alternative antibody format and can quickly be adapted to detect novel antigens by camelidae immunization or synthetic libraries. In this study, we exemplarily produced different mono- and bivalent SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies directed against the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as Cts1 fusions and screened their antigen binding affinity in vitro and in vivo. Functional nanobody-Cts1 fusions were immobilized on chitin forming an RBD tethering surface. This provides a solid base for future development of inexpensive antigen tests utilizing unconventionally secreted nanobodies as antigen trap and a matching ubiquitous and biogenic surface for immobilization.

Title = Determining the International Spread of B.1.1.523 SARS-CoV-2 Lineage with a Set of Mutations Highly Associated with Reduced Immune Neutralization

Here, we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.1.523 that contains a set of mutations including 156_158del, E484K and S494P in the spike protein. E484K and S494P are known to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by convalescent and vaccinated sera and are considered as mutations of concern. Lineage B.1.1.523 presumably originated in the Russian Federation and spread across European countries with the peak of transmission in April–May 2021. The B.1.1.523 lineage has now been reported from 31 countries. In this article, we analyze the possible origin of this mutation subset and its immune response using in silico methods.

Title = Multivalent designed proteins neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and confer protection against infection in mice

New variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to arise and prolong the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here we used a cell-free expression workflow to rapidly screen and optimize constructs containing multiple computationally designed miniprotein inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. We found the broadest efficacy with a homo-trimeric version of the 75-residue angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mimic AHB2 (TRI2–2) designed to geometrically match the trimeric spike architecture. In the cryo-electron microscopy structure, TRI2 formed a tripod on top of the spike protein which engaged all three receptor binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously as in the design model. TRI2–2 neutralized Omicron (B.1.1.529), Delta (B.1.617.2), and all other variants tested with greater potency than that of monoclonal antibodies used clinically for the treatment of COVID-19. TRI2–2 also conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge when administered intranasally in mice. Designed miniprotein receptor mimics geometrically arrayed to match pathogen receptor binding sites could be a widely applicable antiviral therapeutic strategy with advantages over antibodies and native receptor traps. By comparison, the designed proteins have resistance to viral escape and antigenic drift by construction, precisely tuned avidity, and greatly reduced chance of autoimmune responses.

Computationally designed trivalent minibinders provide therapeutic protection in mice against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Title = An ultrapotent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by stabilizing inactive Spike

Monoclonal antibodies that bind to the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) show therapeutic promise but must be produced in mammalian cells and need to be delivered intravenously. By contrast, single-domain antibodies called nanobodies can be produced in bacteria or yeast, and their stability may enable aerosol delivery. Two papers now report nanobodies that bind tightly to spike and efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cells. Schoof et al. screened a yeast surface display of synthetic nanobodies and Xiang et al. screened anti-spike nanobodies produced by a llama. Both groups identified highly potent nanobodies that lock the spike protein in an inactive conformation. Multivalent constructs of selected nanobodies achieved even more potent neutralization.

Science, this issue p. 1473, p. 

Potent neutralizers of SARS-CoV-2 are identified by screening either synthetic or llama-produced nanobodies.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains locked into their inaccessible down state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment, which enables aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia.

Title = Perturbation of the host cell Ca2+ homeostasis and ER-mitochondria contact sites by the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins E and M

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The clinical phenotypes are variable, ranging from spontaneous recovery to serious illness and death. On March 2020, a global COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February 2023, almost 670 million cases and 6,8 million deaths have been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, contain a single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a viral capsid consisting of four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, in the ribonucleoprotein core, the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the membrane (M) protein, embedded in the surface envelope. In particular, the E protein is a poorly characterized viroporin with high identity amongst all the β-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43) and a low mutation rate. Here, we focused our attention on the study of SARS-CoV-2 E and M proteins, and we found a general perturbation of the host cell calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and a selective rearrangement of the interorganelle contact sites. In vitro and in vivo biochemical analyses revealed that the binding of specific nanobodies to soluble regions of SARS-CoV-2 E protein reversed the observed phenotypes, suggesting that the E protein might be an important therapeutic candidate not only for vaccine development, but also for the clinical management of COVID designing drug regimens that, so far, are very limited.

Title = Broad Sarbecovirus Neutralizing Antibodies Obtained by Computational Design and Synthetic Library Screening

Members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae have twice caused deadly threats to humans. There is increasing concern about the rapid mutation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has evolved into multiple generations of epidemic variants in 3 years. Broad neutralizing antibodies are of great importance for pandemic preparedness against SARS-CoV-2 variants and divergent zoonotic sarbecoviruses. Here, we analyzed the structural conservation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from representative sarbecoviruses and chose S2H97, a previously reported RBD antibody with ideal breadth and resistance to escape, as a template for computational design to enhance the neutralization activity and spectrum. A total of 35 designs were purified for evaluation. The neutralizing activity of a large proportion of these designs against multiple variants was increased from several to hundreds of times. Molecular dynamics simulation suggested that extra interface contacts and enhanced intermolecular interactions between the RBD and the designed antibodies are established. After light and heavy chain reconstitution, AI-1028, with five complementarity determining regions optimized, showed the best neutralizing activity across all tested sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, and bat-derived viruses. AI-1028 recognized the same cryptic RBD epitope as the parental prototype antibody. In addition to computational design, chemically synthesized nanobody libraries are also a precious resource for rapid antibody development. By applying distinct RBDs as baits for reciprocal screening, we identified two novel nanobodies with broad activities. These findings provide potential pan-sarbecovirus neutralizing drugs and highlight new pathways to rapidly optimize therapeutic candidates when novel SARS-CoV-2 escape variants or new zoonotic coronaviruses emerge.

IMPORTANCE The subgenus Sarbecovirus includes human SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and hundreds of genetically related bat viruses. The continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the striking evasion of neutralizing antibody (NAb) drugs and convalescent plasma. Antibodies with broad activity across sarbecoviruses would be helpful to combat current SARS-CoV-2 mutations and longer term animal virus spillovers. The study of pan-sarbecovirus NAbs described here is significant for the following reasons. First, we established a structure-based computational pipeline to design and optimize NAbs to obtain more potent and broader neutralizing activity across multiple sarbecoviruses. Second, we screened and identified nanobodies from a highly diversified synthetic library with a broad neutralizing spectrum using an elaborate screening strategy. These methodologies provide guidance for the rapid development of antibody therapeutics against emerging pathogens with highly variable characteristics.

Title = Reduced B cell antigenicity of Omicron lowers host serologic response

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades most neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies and is associated with lower antibody titers upon breakthrough infections than previous variants. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we find using a geometric deep-learning model that Omicron’s extensively mutated receptor binding site (RBS) features reduced antigenicity compared with previous variants. Mice immunization experiments with different recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) variants confirm that the serological response to Omicron is drastically attenuated and less potent. Analyses of serum cross-reactivity and competitive ELISA reveal a reduction in antibody response across both variable and conserved RBD epitopes. Computational modeling confirms that the RBS has a potential for further antigenicity reduction while retaining efficient receptor binding. Finally, we find a similar trend of antigenicity reduction over decades for hCoV229E, a common cold coronavirus. Thus, our study explains the reduced antibody titers associated with Omicron infection and reveals a possible trajectory of future viral evolution.

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades most neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies and is associated with lower antibody titers upon breakthrough infections than previous variants. Tubiana et al. investigate the underlying mechanism using geometric deep learning, mice immunization experiments, and biochemical assays.

Title = Cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins by nanobody-binding scaffolds (Legobodies)

Structure determination by cryo-EM is difficult or impossible to apply to proteins smaller than ∼100 kDa, excluding many membrane proteins and proteins of pharmaceutical importance from the analysis. Here, we report on a general method that allows structure determination of small proteins. The method is based on the availability of a nanobody to a target protein. The nanobody is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. We call the overall ensemble Legobody. The method is demonstrated for two small proteins that have sizes of ∼22 kDa.

We describe a general method that allows structure determination of small proteins by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: 1) a Fab fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody and 2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of ∼120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody–target interaction, is easily recognizable in EM images due to its unique shape, and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23-kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2-Å overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22-kDa receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6-Å resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody. The Legobody approach thus overcomes the current size limitations of cryo-EM analysis.

Title = De novo design of potent and resilient hACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2

Many efforts to develop therapies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are focused on the interaction between the spike protein, which decorates the surface of the virus, and its host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Linsky et al. describe a de novo design strategy that allowed them to engineer decoy proteins that bind to the spike protein by replicating the hACE2 interface. The best decoy, CTC-445, bound with low nanomolar affinity, and selection of viral mutants that decrease binding is unlikely because this would also affect binding to hACE2. A bivalent version of CTC-445 bound even more tightly, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, and protected hamsters from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge. The stable decoy has the potential for respiratory therapeutic delivery.

Science, this issue p. 1208

Designed de novo protein decoys neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and are resilient to viral mutational escape.

We developed a de novo protein design strategy to swiftly engineer decoys for neutralizing pathogens that exploit extracellular host proteins to infect the cell. Our pipeline allowed the design, validation, and optimization of de novo human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) decoys to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The best monovalent decoy, CTC-445.2, bound with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that the design is accurate and can simultaneously bind to all three RBDs of a single spike protein. Because the decoy replicates the spike protein target interface in hACE2, it is intrinsically resilient to viral mutational escape. A bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, showed ~10-fold improvement in binding. CTC-445.2d potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells in vitro, and a single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected Syrian hamsters from a subsequent lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Title = Nanobody engineering: computational modelling and design for biomedical and therapeutic applications

Nanobodies, the smallest functional antibody fragment derived from camelid heavy‐chain‐only antibodies, have emerged as powerful tools for diverse biomedical applications. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the structural characteristics, functional properties, and computational approaches driving the design and optimisation of synthetic nanobodies. We explore their unique antigen‐binding domains, highlighting the critical role of complementarity‐determining regions in target recognition and specificity. This review further underscores the advantages of nanobodies over conventional antibodies from a biosynthesis perspective, including their small size, stability, and solubility, which make them ideal candidates for economical antigen capture in diagnostics, therapeutics, and biosensing. We discuss the recent advancements in computational methods for nanobody modelling, epitope prediction, and affinity maturation, shedding light on their intricate antigen‐binding mechanisms and conformational dynamics. Finally, we examine a direct example of how computational design strategies were implemented for improving a nanobody‐based immunosensor, known as a Quenchbody. Through combining experimental findings and computational insights, this review elucidates the transformative impact of nanobodies in biotechnology and biomedical research, offering a roadmap for future advancements and applications in healthcare and diagnostics.

Title = Ultrapotent human antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge via multiple mechanisms

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is initiated by the trimeric spike protein that decorates the virus and binds the ACE2 receptor. Antibodies against the spike that neutralize viral infection have potential as therapeutics. Tortorici et al. describe two very potent antibodies, S2E12 and S2M11. Electron microscopy structures characterized the binding and showed that S2E12 traps the spike in a conformation that cannot bind ACE2. Both antibodies protected hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge and may be useful in antibody cocktails to combat the virus and prevent the development of resistance.

Science, this issue p. 950

A potent antibody cocktail blocks attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the host receptor and activates a protective immune response.

Efficient therapeutic options are needed to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused more than 922,000 fatalities as of 13 September 2020. We report the isolation and characterization of two ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 human neutralizing antibodies (S2E12 and S2M11) that protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Cryo–electron microscopy structures show that S2E12 and S2M11 competitively block angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) attachment and that S2M11 also locks the spike in a closed conformation by recognition of a quaternary epitope spanning two adjacent receptor-binding domains. Antibody cocktails that include S2M11, S2E12, or the previously identified S309 antibody broadly neutralize a panel of circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates and activate effector functions. Our results pave the way to implement antibody cocktails for prophylaxis or therapy, circumventing or limiting the emergence of viral escape mutants.

Title = Modeling of ACE2 and antibodies bound to SARS-CoV-2 provides insights into infectivity and immune evasion

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there is interest in understanding ligand-receptor features and targeted antibody-binding attributes against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we developed a large-scale structure-based pipeline for analysis of protein-protein interactions regulating SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion. First, we generated computed structural models of the Spike protein of 3 SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.529, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5) bound either to a native receptor (ACE2) or to a large panel of targeted ligands (n = 282), which included neutralizing or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, by using the Barnes classification, we noted an overall loss of interfacial interactions (with gain of new interactions in certain cases) at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediated by substituted residues for neutralizing complexes in classes 1 and 2, whereas less destabilization was observed for classes 3 and 4. Finally, an experimental validation of predicted weakened therapeutic antibody binding was performed in a cell-based assay. Compared with the original Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), derivative variants featured progressive destabilization of antibody-RBD interfaces mediated by a larger set of substituted residues, thereby providing a molecular basis for immune evasion. This approach and findings provide a framework for rapidly and efficiently generating structural models for SARS-CoV-2 variants bound to ligands of mechanistic and therapeutic value.

As the world struggles with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, unprecedented obstacles have continuously been traversed as new SARS-CoV-2 variants continually emerge. Infectious disease outbreaks are unavoidable, but the knowledge gained from the successes and failures will help create a robust health management system to deal with such pandemics. Previously, scientists required years to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines; however, we have seen that, with the rapid deployment of high-throughput technologies and unprecedented scientific collaboration worldwide, breakthrough discoveries can be accelerated and insights broadened. Computational protein design (CPD) is a game-changing new technology that has provided alternative therapeutic strategies for pandemic management. In addition to the development of peptide-based inhibitors, miniprotein binders, decoys, biosensors, nanobodies, and monoclonal antibodies, CPD has also been used to redesign native SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human ACE2 receptors. We discuss how novel CPD strategies have been exploited to develop rationally designed and robust COVID-19 treatment strategies.

This outlook summarizes CPD approaches utilized for the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and highlights the current challenges and future directions of CPD to tackle various infectious diseases.

Title = Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography utilizing nanobody technology for expression screening of membrane proteins

GFP fusion-based fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) has been widely employed for membrane protein expression screening. However, fused GFP itself may occasionally affect the expression and/or stability of the targeted membrane protein, leading to both false-positive and false-negative results in expression screening. Furthermore, GFP fusion technology is not well suited for some membrane proteins, depending on their membrane topology. Here, we developed an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody (Nb) technology, named FSEC-Nb, in which targeted membrane proteins are fused to a small peptide tag and recombinantly expressed. The whole-cell extracts are solubilized, mixed with anti-peptide Nb fused to GFP for FSEC analysis. FSEC-Nb enables the evaluation of the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need for purification but does not require direct GFP fusion to targeted proteins. Our results show FSEC-Nb as a powerful tool for expression screening of membrane proteins for structural and functional studies.

To mitigate the GFP-triggered artifacts in Fluorescence-detection Size-Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC), Jin et al. develop an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody technology which allows evaluation of the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need for purification. It holds promise as a powerful tool for screening of membrane proteins for functional and structural studies.

Title = Novel Mode of nanoLuciferase Packaging in SARS-CoV-2 Virions and VLPs Provides Versatile Reporters for Virus Production

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family that is responsible for morbidity and mortality worldwide. To better understand the molecular pathways leading to SARS-CoV-2 virus assembly, we examined a virus-like particle (VLP) system co-expressing all structural proteins together with an mRNA reporter encoding nanoLuciferase (herein nLuc). Surprisingly, the 19 kDa nLuc protein itself was encapsidated into VLPs, providing a better reporter than nLuc mRNA itself. Strikingly, infecting nLuc-expressing cells with the SARS-CoV-2, NL63 or OC43 coronaviruses yielded virions containing packaged nLuc that served to report viral production. In contrast, infection with the flaviviruses, dengue or Zika, did not lead to nLuc packaging and secretion. A panel of reporter protein variants revealed that the packaging is size-limited and requires cytoplasmic expression, indicating that the large virion of coronaviruses can encaspidate a small cytoplasmic reporter protein. Our findings open the way for powerful new approaches to measure coronavirus particle production, egress and viral entry mechanisms.

Title = Biosynthetic proteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike as anti-virals

The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes virus entry into the cell. Targeting this interaction represents a promising strategy to generate antivirals. By screening a phage-display library of biosynthetic protein sequences build on a rigid alpha-helicoidal HEAT-like scaffold (named αReps), we selected candidates recognizing the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Two of them (F9 and C2) bind the RBD with affinities in the nM range, displaying neutralisation activity in vitro and recognizing distinct sites, F9 overlapping the ACE2 binding motif. The F9-C2 fusion protein and a trivalent αRep form (C2-foldon) display 0.1 nM affinities and EC50 of 8–18 nM for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. In hamsters, F9-C2 instillation in the nasal cavity before or during infections effectively reduced the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 strain harbouring the D614G mutation in the nasal epithelium. Furthermore, F9-C2 and/or C2-foldon effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants (including delta and omicron variants) with EC50 values ranging from 13 to 32 nM. With their high stability and their high potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants, αReps provide a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics to target the nasal cavity and mitigate virus dissemination in the proximal environment.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in permissive cells is mediated by the binding of its spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. To select ligands able to block this interaction, we screened a library of phages encoding biosynthetic proteins (named αReps) for binding to its receptor binding domain (RBD). Two of them were able to bind the RBD with high affinity and block efficiently the virus entry in cultured cells. Assembled αReps through covalent or non-covalent linkages blocked virus entry at lower concentration than their precursors (with around 20-fold activity increase for a trimeric αRep). These αReps derivates neutralize efficiently SARS-CoV-2 β, γ, δ and Omicron virus variants. Instillation of an αRep dimer in the nasal cavity effectively reduced virus replication in the hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenicity.

Title = Targeting the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein: from antibodies to miniproteins and peptides

Coronavirus disease-19, caused by the novel β-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has created a global pandemic unseen in a century. Rapid worldwide efforts have enabled the characterization of the virus and its pathogenic mechanism. An early key finding is that SARS-CoV-2 uses spike proteins, the virus' most exposed structures, to bind to human ACE2 receptors and initiate cell invasion. Competitive targeting of the spike protein is a promising strategy to neutralize virus infectivity. This review article summarizes the discovery, binding modes and eventual applications of several classes of (bio)molecules targeting the spike protein: antibodies, nanobodies, soluble ACE2 variants, miniproteins, peptides and small molecules.

Title = Genetically Engineered MRI-Trackable Extracellular Vesicles as SARS-CoV-2 Mimetics for Mapping ACE2 Binding In Vivo

The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding of virus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of a pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, and protein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, their rapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complex in vivo setup call for further developments. Here, we show the development of biocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that display the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirus mimetics (EVsRBD). Loading EVsRBD with iron oxide nanoparticles makes them MRI-visible and, thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptors noninvasively in live subjects. Moreover, we show that EVsRBD can be modified to display mutants of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, allowing rapid screening of currently raised or predicted variants of the virus. The proposed platform thus shows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner. Relying on MRI for visualization, the presented approach could be considered in the future to map ligand-receptor binding events in deep tissues, which are not accessible to luminescence-based imaging.

Title = The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain

Antibodies are crucial to immune protection against SARS-CoV-2, with some in emergency use as therapeutics. Here, we identify 377 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the virus spike and focus mainly on 80 that bind the receptor binding domain (RBD). We devise a competition data-driven method to map RBD binding sites. We find that although antibody binding sites are widely dispersed, neutralizing antibody binding is focused, with nearly all highly inhibitory mAbs (IC50 < 0.1 μg/mL) blocking receptor interaction, except for one that binds a unique epitope in the N-terminal domain. Many of these neutralizing mAbs use public V-genes and are close to germline. We dissect the structural basis of recognition for this large panel of antibodies through X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy of 19 Fab-antigen structures. We find novel binding modes for some potently inhibitory antibodies and demonstrate that strongly neutralizing mAbs protect, prophylactically or therapeutically, in animal models.

Dejnirattisai et al. present an in-depth study of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By characterizing 377 human mAbs from recovered COVID-19 patients, and determining 19 protein structures, they construct a map of antibody footprints on the RBD that describes in great detail its antigenic anatomy.

Title = Design of functionalised circular tandem repeat proteins with longer repeat topologies and enhanced subunit contact surfaces

Circular tandem repeat proteins (‘cTRPs’) are de novo designed protein scaffolds (in this and prior studies, based on antiparallel two-helix bundles) that contain repeated protein sequences and structural motifs and form closed circular structures. They can display significant stability and solubility, a wide range of sizes, and are useful as protein display particles for biotechnology applications. However, cTRPs also demonstrate inefficient self-assembly from smaller subunits. In this study, we describe a new generation of cTRPs, with longer repeats and increased interaction surfaces, which enhanced the self-assembly of two significantly different sizes of homotrimeric constructs. Finally, we demonstrated functionalization of these constructs with (1) a hexameric array of peptide-binding SH2 domains, and (2) a trimeric array of anti-SARS CoV-2 VHH domains. The latter proved capable of sub-nanomolar binding affinities towards the viral receptor binding domain and potent viral neutralization function.

Jazmine Hallinan et al. report the development of a new generation of circular tandem repeat proteins with enhanced self-assembly. Functionalisation of these constructs with SARS CoV-2 VHH domains resulted in sub-nanomolar binding affinity to the viral receptor binding domain.

Title = Biochemical and structural insights into SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein processing by Mpro

SARS-CoV-2, a human coronavirus, is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its genome is translated into two large polyproteins subsequently cleaved by viral papain-like protease and main protease (Mpro). Polyprotein processing is essential yet incompletely understood. We studied Mpro-mediated processing of the nsp7-11 polyprotein, whose mature products include cofactors of the viral replicase, and identified the order of cleavages. Integrative modeling based on mass spectrometry (including hydrogen-deuterium exchange and cross-linking) and x-ray scattering yielded a nsp7-11 structural ensemble, demonstrating shared secondary structural elements with individual nsps. The pattern of cross-links and HDX footprint of the C145A Mpro and nsp7-11 complex demonstrate preferential binding of the enzyme active site to the polyprotein junction sites and additional transient contacts to help orient the enzyme on its substrate for cleavage. Last, proteolysis assays were used to characterize the effect of inhibitors/binders on Mpro processing/inhibition using the nsp7-11 polyprotein as substrate.

Title =  De novo design of a stapled peptide targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain†

Although effective vaccines have been developed against SARS-CoV-2, many regions in the world still have low rates of vaccination and new variants with mutations in the viral spike protein have reduced the effectiveness of most available vaccines and treatments. There is an urgent need for a drug to cure this disease and prevent infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host cell through protein–protein interaction between the virus's spike protein and the host's angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). Using protein design software and molecular dynamics simulations, we have designed a 17-residue peptide (pep39), that binds to the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and blocks interaction of spike protein with ACE2. We have confirmed the binding activity of the designed peptide for the original spike protein and the delta variant spike protein using micro-cantilever and bio-layer interferometry (BLI) based methods. We also confirmed that pep39 strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero E6 cells. Taken together these data suggest that a newly designed spike protein RBD blocking peptide pep39 has a potential as a SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitor.

Title = Tetravalent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Show Enhanced Potency and Resistance to Escape Mutations

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) hold promise as therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we describe protein engineering and modular design principles that have led to the development of synthetic bivalent and tetravalent nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. The best nAb targets the host receptor binding site of the viral S-protein and tetravalent versions block entry with a potency exceeding bivalent nAbs by an order of magnitude. Structural studies show that both the bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can make multivalent interactions with a single S-protein trimer, consistent with the avidity and potency of these molecules. Significantly, we show that the tetravalent nAbs show increased tolerance to potential virus escape mutants and an emerging variant of concern. Bivalent and tetravalent nAbs can be produced at large-scale and are as stable and specific as approved antibody drugs. Our results provide a general framework for enhancing antiviral therapies against COVID-19 and related viral threats, and our strategy can be applied to virtually any antibody drug.

Title = Reduced antigenicity of Omicron lowers host serologic response

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) contains fifteen mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD), evading most neutralizing antibodies from vaccinated sera. Emerging evidence suggests that Omicron breakthrough cases are associated with substantially lower antibody titers than other VOC cases. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, using a novel geometric deep-learning model, we discovered that the antigenic profile of Omicron RBD is distinct from the prior VOCs, featuring reduced antigenicity in its remodeled receptor binding sites (RBS). To substantiate our deep-learning prediction, we immunized mice with different recombinant RBD variants and found that the Omicron’s extensive mutations can lead to a drastically attenuated serologic response with limited neutralizing activity in vivo, while the T cell response remains potent. Analyses of serum cross-reactivity and competitive ELISA with epitope-specific nanobodies revealed that the antibody response to Omicron was reduced across RBD epitopes, including both the variable RBS and epitopes without any known VOC mutations. Moreover, computational modeling confirmed that the RBS is highly versatile with a capacity to further decrease antigenicity while retaining efficient receptor binding. Longitudinal analysis showed that this evolutionary trend of decrease in antigenicity was also found in hCoV229E, a common cold coronavirus that has been circulating in humans for decades. Thus, our study provided unprecedented insights into the reduced antibody titers associated with Omicron infection, revealed a possible trajectory of future viral evolution and may inform the vaccine development against future outbreaks.

Title = SARS-CoV-2 Resistance to Small Molecule Inhibitors

SARS-CoV-2 undergoes genetic mutations like many other viruses. Some mutations lead to the emergence of new Variants of Concern (VOCs), affecting transmissibility, illness severity, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs. Continuous monitoring and research are crucial to comprehend variant behavior and develop effective response strategies, including identifying mutations that may affect current drug therapies.

Antiviral therapies such as Nirmatrelvir and Ensitrelvir focus on inhibiting 3CLpro, whereas Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Molnupiravir target nsp12, thereby reducing the viral load. However, the emergence of resistant mutations in 3CLpro and nsp12 could impact the efficiency of these small molecule drug therapeutics.

This manuscript summarizes mutations in 3CLpro and nsp12, which could potentially reduce the efficacy of drugs. Additionally, it encapsulates recent advancements in small molecule antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, including their potential for developing resistance against emerging variants.

Title = A Collection of Designed Peptides to Target SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD—ACE2 Interaction

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor used by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to attach to cells via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their viral spike protein. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several structures of protein complexes involving ACE2 and RBD as well as monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies have become available. We have leveraged the structural data to design peptides to target the interaction between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 and SARS-CoV and ACE2, as contrasting exemplar, as well as the dimerization surface of ACE2 monomers. The peptides were modelled using our original method: PiPreD that uses native elements of the interaction between the targeted protein and cognate partner(s) that are subsequently included in the designed peptides. These peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conformations surrogating key interactions at the interface. To facilitate the access to this information we have created a freely available and dedicated web-based repository, PepI-Covid19 database, providing convenient access to this wealth of information to the scientific community with the view of maximizing its potential impact in the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents.

Title = Structural models of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in complex with ACE2 receptor or antibodies suggest altered binding interfaces

There is enormous ongoing interest in characterizing the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern (VOC) (B.1.1.529), which continues to spread towards potential dominance worldwide. To aid these studies, based on the wealth of available structural information about several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and a modeling pipeline we have previously developed for tracking the ongoing global evolution of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we provide a set of computed structural models (henceforth models) of the Omicron VOC receptor-binding domain (omRBD) bound to its corresponding receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2) and a variety of therapeutic entities, including neutralizing and therapeutic antibodies targeting previously-detected viral strains. We generated bound omRBD models using both experimentally-determined structures in the PDB as well as machine learning-based structure predictions as starting points. Examination of ACE2-bound omRBD models reveals an interdigitated multi-residue interaction network formed by omRBD-specific substituted residues (R493, S496, Y501, R498) and ACE2 residues at the interface, which was not present in the original Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. Emergence of this interaction network suggests optimization of a key region of the binding interface, and positive cooperativity among various sites of residue substitutions in omRBD mediating ACE2 binding. Examination of neutralizing antibody complexes for Barnes Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies modeled with omRBD highlights an overall loss of interfacial interactions (with gain of new interactions in rare cases) mediated by substituted residues. Many of these substitutions have previously been found to independently dampen or even ablate antibody binding, and perhaps mediate antibody-mediated neutralization escape (e.g., K417N). We observe little compensation of corresponding interaction loss at interfaces when potential escape substitutions occur in combination. A few selected antibodies (e.g., Barnes Class 3 S309), however, feature largely unaltered or modestly affected protein-protein interfaces. While we stress that only qualitative insights can be obtained directly from our models at this time, we anticipate that they can provide starting points for more detailed and quantitative computational characterization, and, if needed, redesign of monoclonal antibodies for targeting the Omicron VOC Spike protein. In the broader context, the computational pipeline we developed provides a framework for rapidly and efficiently generating retrospective and prospective models for other novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 bound to entities of virological and therapeutic interest, in the setting of a global pandemic.

Title = VHH Structural Modelling Approaches: A Critical Review

VHH, i.e., VH domains of camelid single-chain antibodies, are very promising therapeutic agents due to their significant physicochemical advantages compared to classical mammalian antibodies. The number of experimentally solved VHH structures has significantly improved recently, which is of great help, because it offers the ability to directly work on 3D structures to humanise or improve them. Unfortunately, most VHHs do not have 3D structures. Thus, it is essential to find alternative ways to get structural information. The methods of structure prediction from the primary amino acid sequence appear essential to bypass this limitation. This review presents the most extensive overview of structure prediction methods applied for the 3D modelling of a given VHH sequence (a total of 21). Besides the historical overview, it aims at showing how model software programs have been shaping the structural predictions of VHHs. A brief explanation of each methodology is supplied, and pertinent examples of their usage are provided. Finally, we present a structure prediction case study of a recently solved VHH structure. According to some recent studies and the present analysis, AlphaFold 2 and NanoNet appear to be the best tools to predict a structural model of VHH from its sequence.

Title = Bi-paratopic and multivalent VH domains block ACE2 binding and neutralize SARS-CoV-2

Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domains toward neutralizing epitopes. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes and further assembled these into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These VH constructs showed increased affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain engaging an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, confirming our original design strategy.

Title = Evolution of nanobodies specific for BCL11A

Nuclear proteins, transcription factors (TFs), regulate many genes relevant to human diseases. Developing tools to study such TFs within intact cells is challenging. Miniature antibodies, nanobodies, are promising reagents for targeting proteins of interest to study function and/or validate therapeutic potential. We have combined several approaches, including protein design, to generate specific nanobodies that recognize TF BCL11A, a central regulator of the switch from fetal to adult-type hemoglobin. These nanobodies distinguish BCL11A from its paralog (BCL11B) and mediate targeted protein degradation of BCL11A within intact cells. These nanobodies provide opportunities for functional assessment of BCL11A and potential identification of small molecule ligands. The strategy employed here can be applied widely to target validation of other TFs within intact cells.

Transcription factors (TFs) control numerous genes that are directly relevant to many human disorders. However, developing specific reagents targeting TFs within intact cells is challenging due to the presence of highly disordered regions within these proteins. Intracellular antibodies offer opportunities to probe protein function and validate therapeutic targets. Here, we describe the optimization of nanobodies specific for BCL11A, a validated target for the treatment of hemoglobin disorders. We obtained first-generation nanobodies directed to a region of BCL11A comprising zinc fingers 4 to 6 (ZF456) from a synthetic yeast surface display library, and employed error-prone mutagenesis, structural determination, and molecular modeling to enhance binding affinity. Engineered nanobodies recognized ZF6 and mediated targeted protein degradation (TPD) of BCL11A protein in erythroid cells, leading to the anticipated reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. Evolved nanobodies distinguished BCL11A from its close paralog BCL11B, which shares an identical DNA-binding specificity. Given the ease of manipulation of nanobodies and their exquisite specificity, nanobody-mediated TPD of TFs should be suitable for dissecting regulatory relationships of TFs and gene targets and validating therapeutic potential of proteins of interest.

Title = An Antigenic Space Framework for Understanding Antibody Escape of SARS-CoV-2 Variants

The evolution of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 at antigenic sites that impact neutralizing antibody responses in humans poses a risk to immunity developed through vaccination and natural infection. The highly successful RNA-based vaccines have enabled rapid vaccine updates that incorporate mutations from current variants of concern (VOCs). It is therefore important to anticipate future antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this goal, we survey epitope-paratope interfaces of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to map an antigenic space that captures the role of each spike protein residue within the polyclonal antibody response directed against the ACE2-receptor binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD). In particular, the antigenic space map builds on recently published epitope definitions by annotating epitope overlap and orthogonality at the residue level. We employ the antigenic space map as a framework to understand how mutations on nine major variants contribute to each variant’s evasion of neutralizing antibodies. Further, we identify constellations of mutations that span the orthogonal epitope regions of the RBD and NTD on the variants with the greatest antibody escape. Finally, we apply the antigenic space map to predict which regions of antigenic space—should they mutate—may be most likely to complementarily augment antibody evasion for the most evasive and transmissible VOCs.

Title = Multivalent designed proteins protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern

Escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge, we developed multivalent protein-based minibinders as potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Homotrimers of single minibinders and fusions of three distinct minibinders were designed to geometrically match the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer architecture and were optimized by cell-free expression and found to exhibit virtually no measurable dissociation upon binding. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) showed that these trivalent minibinders engage all three receptor binding domains on a single S trimer. The top candidates neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with IC50 values in the low pM range, resist viral escape, and provide protection in highly vulnerable human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Our integrated workflow promises to accelerate the design of mutationally resilient therapeutics for pandemic preparedness.

We designed, developed, and characterized potent, trivalent miniprotein binders that provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Title = Bi-paratopic and multivalent human VH domains neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting distinct epitopes within the ACE2 binding interface of Spike

Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.

Title = Atomically accurate de novo design of single-domain antibodies

Despite the central role that antibodies play in modern medicine, there is currently no way to rationally design novel antibodies to bind a specific epitope on a target. Instead, antibody discovery currently involves time-consuming immunization of an animal or library screening approaches. Here we demonstrate that a fine-tuned RFdiffusion network is capable of designing de novo antibody variable heavy chains (VHH’s) that bind user-specified epitopes. We experimentally confirm binders to four disease-relevant epitopes, and the cryo-EM structure of a designed VHH bound to influenza hemagglutinin is nearly identical to the design model both in the configuration of the CDR loops and the overall binding pose.

This perspective sheds light on the transformative impact of recent computational advancements in the field of protein therapeutics, with a particular focus on the design and development of antibodies. Cutting-edge computational methods have revolutionized our understanding of protein–protein interactions (PPIs), enhancing the efficacy of protein therapeutics in preclinical and clinical settings. Central to these advancements is the application of machine learning and deep learning, which offers unprecedented insights into the intricate mechanisms of PPIs and facilitates precise control over protein functions.

These studies focus on key performance metrics such as accuracy and the ease of program execution, providing a valuable resource for researchers engaged in antibody design and development. Through this detailed perspective, we aim to contribute to the advancement of antibody design, equipping researchers with the tools and knowledge to navigate the complexities of this field.

Title = Protein Engineering in the Design of Protein–Protein Interactions: SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors as a Test Case

The formation of specific protein–protein interactions (PPIs) drive most biological processes. Malfunction of such interactions is the molecular driver of many diseases. Our ability to engineer existing PPIs or create new ones has become a vital research tool. In addition, engineered proteins with new or altered interactions are among the most critical drugs that have been developed in recent years. These include antibodies, cytokines, inhibitors, and others. Here, we provide a perspective on the current status of the methods used to engineer new or altered PPIs. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worldwide quest to develop specific PPI inhibitors as drugs, provided an up-to-date and state-of-the-art status report on the methodologies for engineering PPIs targeting the interaction of the viral spike protein with its cellular target, ACE2. Multiple, very high affinity binders were generated within a few months using in vitro evolution by itself, or in combination with computational design. The different experimental and computational methods used to block this interaction provide a road map for the future of PPI engineering.

Title = PAbFold: Linear Antibody Epitope Prediction using AlphaFold2

Defining the binding epitopes of antibodies is essential for understanding how they bind to their antigens and perform their molecular functions. However, while determining linear epitopes of monoclonal antibodies can be accomplished utilizing well-established empirical procedures, these approaches are generally labor- and time-intensive and costly. To take advantage of the recent advances in protein structure prediction algorithms available to the scientific community, we developed a calculation pipeline based on the localColabFold implementation of AlphaFold2 that can predict linear antibody epitopes by predicting the structure of the complex between antibody heavy and light chains and target peptide sequences derived from antigens. We found that this AlphaFold2 pipeline, which we call PAbFold, was able to accurately flag known epitope sequences for several well-known antibody targets (HA / Myc) when the target sequence was broken into small overlapping linear peptides and antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) were grafted onto several different antibody framework regions in the single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) format. To determine if this pipeline was able to identify the epitope of a novel antibody with no structural information publicly available, we determined the epitope of a novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid targeted antibody using our method and then experimentally validated our computational results using peptide competition ELISA assays. These results indicate that the AlphaFold2-based PAbFold pipeline we developed is capable of accurately identifying linear antibody epitopes in a short time using just antibody and target protein sequences. This emergent capability of the method is sensitive to methodological details such as peptide length, AlphaFold2 neural network versions, and multiple-sequence alignment database. PAbFold is available at https://github.com/jbderoo/PAbFold.

Title = Broadly neutralizing antibodies against emerging delta-coronaviruses

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) spillovers were recently detected in children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness, underscoring recurrent zoonoses of divergent coronaviruses. To date, no vaccines or specific therapeutics are approved for use in humans against PDCoV. To prepare for possible future PDCoV epidemics, we isolated human spike (S)-directed monoclonal antibodies from transgenic mice and found that two of them, designated PD33 and PD41, broadly neutralized a panel of PDCoV variants. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of PD33 and PD41 in complex with the PDCoV receptor-binding domain and S ectodomain trimer provide a blueprint of the epitopes recognized by these mAbs, rationalizing their broad inhibitory activity. We show that both mAbs inhibit PDCoV by competitively interfering with host APN binding to the PDCoV receptor-binding loops, explaining the mechanism of viral neutralization. PD33 and PD41 are candidates for clinical advancement, which could be stockpiled to prepare for possible future PDCoV outbreaks.

Title = Combinatorially restricted computational design of protein-protein interfaces to produce IgG heterodimers

Redesigning protein-protein interfaces is an important tool for developing therapeutic strategies. Interfaces can be redesigned by in silico screening, which allows for efficient sampling of a large protein space before experimental validation. However, computational costs limit the number of combinations that can be reasonably sampled. Here, we present combinatorial tyrosine (Y)/serine (S) selection (combYSelect), a computational approach combining in silico determination of the change in binding free energy (ΔΔG) of an interface with a highly restricted library composed of just two amino acids, tyrosine and serine. We used combYSelect to design two immunoglobulin G (IgG) heterodimers—combYSelect1 (L368S/D399Y-K409S/T411Y) and combYSelect2 (D399Y/K447S-K409S/T411Y)—that exhibit near-optimal heterodimerization, without affecting IgG stability or function. We solved the crystal structures of these heterodimers and found that dynamic π-stacking interactions and polar contacts drive preferential heterodimeric interactions. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of our combYSelect heterodimers by engineering both a bispecific antibody and a cytokine trap for two unique therapeutic applications.

combYSelect is an in silico screening strategy for redesigning protein-protein interfaces using a restricted amino acid library.

Title = Mapping Potential Antigenic Drift Sites (PADS) on SARS-CoV-2 Spike in Continuous Epitope-Paratope Space

SARS-CoV-2 mutations with antigenic effects pose a risk to immunity developed through vaccination and natural infection. While vaccine updates for current variants of concern (VOCs) are underway, it is likewise important to prepare for further antigenic mutations as the virus navigates the heterogeneous global landscape of host immunity. Toward this end, a wealth of data and tools exist that can augment existing genetic surveillance of VOC evolution. In this study, we integrate published datasets describing genetic, structural, and functional constraints on mutation along with computational analyses of antibody-spike co-crystal structures to identify a set of potential antigenic drift sites (PADS) within the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further, we project the PADS set into a continuous epitope-paratope space to facilitate interpretation of the degree to which newly observed mutations might be antigenically synergistic with existing VOC mutations, and this representation suggests that functionally convergent and synergistic antigenic mutations are accruing across VOC NTDs. The PADS set and synergy visualization serve as a reference as new mutations are detected on VOCs, enable proactive investigation of potentially synergistic mutations, and offer guidance to antibody and vaccine design efforts.

Title = Insights on the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant receptor-binding domain

The Omicron variant features enhanced transmissibility and antibody escape. Here, we describe the Omicron receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutational landscape using amino acid interaction (AAI) networks, which are well suited for interrogating constellations of mutations that function in an epistatic manner. Using AAI, we map Omicron mutations directly and indirectly driving increased escape breadth and depth in class 1–4 antibody epitopes. Further, we present epitope networks for authorized therapeutic antibodies and assess perturbations to each antibody’s epitope. Since our initial modeling following the identification of Omicron, these predictions have been realized by experimental findings of Omicron neutralization escape from therapeutic antibodies ADG20, AZD8895, and AZD1061. Importantly, the AAI predicted escape resulting from indirect epitope perturbations was not captured by previous sequence or point mutation analyses. Finally, for several Omicron RBD mutations, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBDdown-RBDdown interface.

Omicron mutations provide plausible structural rationale for enhanced transmission

The Omicron variant possesses 15 RBD mutations that together produce enhanced functions as compared with these mutations in isolation. Here, Miller et al. present a protein network analysis of the mutational landscape of the Omicron RBD. Their analysis can guide investigations of future variants and design of variant-proof therapeutic antibodies.

Title = Close relatives of MERS-CoV in bats use ACE2 as their functional receptors

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and several bat coronaviruses use dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor. However, the receptor for NeoCoV—the closest known MERS-CoV relative found in bats—remains unclear. Here, using a pseudotype virus entry assay, we found that NeoCoV and its close relative, PDF-2180, can efficiently bind to and use specific bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologues and, less favourably, human ACE2 as entry receptors through their receptor-binding domains (RBDs) on the spike (S) proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed an RBD–ACE2 binding interface involving protein–glycan interactions, distinct from those of other known ACE2-using coronaviruses. We identified residues 337–342 of human ACE2 as a molecular determinant restricting NeoCoV entry, whereas a NeoCoV S pseudotyped virus containing a T510F RBD mutation efficiently entered cells expressing human ACE2. Although polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or MERS-CoV RBD-specific nanobodies did not cross-neutralize NeoCoV or PDF-2180, an ACE2-specific antibody and two broadly neutralizing betacoronavirus antibodies efficiently inhibited these two pseudotyped viruses. We describe MERS-CoV-related viruses that use ACE2 as an entry receptor, underscoring a promiscuity of receptor use and a potential zoonotic threat.

NeoCoV and its close relative, PDF-2180, can efficiently bind to and use specific bat ACE2 orthologues and, less favourably, human ACE2 as entry receptors through their receptor-binding domains on the spike protein.

Title = Characterization of a human monoclonal antibody generated from a B-cell specific for a prefusion-stabilized spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory infection and continues to infect humans, thereby contributing to a high mortality rate (34.3% in 2019). In the absence of an available licensed vaccine and antiviral agent, therapeutic human antibodies have been suggested as candidates for treatment. In this study, human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by sorting B cells from patient’s PBMC cells with prefusion stabilized spike (S) probes and a direct immunoglobulin cloning strategy. We identified six receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific and five S1 (non-RBD)-specific antibodies, among which, only the RBD-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing potency (IC50 0.006–1.787 μg/ml) as well as high affinity to RBD. Notably, passive immunization using a highly potent antibody (KNIH90-F1) at a relatively low dose (2 mg/kg) completely protected transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 against MERS-CoV lethal challenge. These results suggested that human monoclonal antibodies isolated by using the rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV S probe could be considered potential candidates for the development of therapeutic and/or prophylactic antiviral agents for MERS-CoV human infection.

Title = Antibody structure prediction using interpretable deep learning

Therapeutic antibodies make up a rapidly growing segment of the biologics market. However, rational design of antibodies is hindered by reliance on experimental methods for determining antibody structures. Here, we present DeepAb, a deep learning method for predicting accurate antibody FV structures from sequence. We evaluate DeepAb on a set of structurally diverse, therapeutically relevant antibodies and find that our method consistently outperforms the leading alternatives. Previous deep learning methods have operated as “black boxes” and offered few insights into their predictions. By introducing a directly interpretable attention mechanism, we show our network attends to physically important residue pairs (e.g., proximal aromatics and key hydrogen bonding interactions). Finally, we present a novel mutant scoring metric derived from network confidence and show that for a particular antibody, all eight of the top-ranked mutations improve binding affinity. This model will be useful for a broad range of antibody prediction and design tasks.

DeepAb, a deep learning method for antibody structure, is presented

Structures from DeepAb are more accurate than alternatives

Outputs of DeepAb provide interpretable insights into structure predictions

DeepAb predictions should facilitate design of novel antibody therapeutics

Accurate structure models are critical for understanding the properties of potential therapeutic antibodies. Conventional methods for protein structure determination require significant investments of time and resources and may fail. Although greatly improved, methods for general protein structure prediction still cannot consistently provide the accuracy necessary to understand or design antibodies. We present a deep learning method for antibody structure prediction and demonstrate improvement over alternatives on diverse, therapeutically relevant benchmarks. In addition to its improved accuracy, our method reveals interpretable outputs about specific amino acids and residue interactions that should facilitate design of novel therapeutic antibodies.

Accurate models of antibody structures are critical for the design of novel antibody therapeutics. We present DeepAb, a deep learning method for predicting antibody structure directly from amino acid sequence. When evaluated on benchmarks balanced for structural diversity and therapeutical relevance, DeepAb outperforms alternative methods. Finally, we dissect the interpretable elements of DeepAb to better understand the features contributing to its predictions and demonstrate how DeepAb could be applied to antibody design.

Title = Machine-designed biotherapeutics: opportunities, feasibility and advantages of deep learning in computational antibody discovery

Antibodies are versatile molecular binders with an established and growing role as therapeutics. Computational approaches to developing and designing these molecules are being increasingly used to complement traditional lab-based processes. Nowadays, in silico methods fill multiple elements of the discovery stage, such as characterizing antibody–antigen interactions and identifying developability liabilities. Recently, computational methods tackling such problems have begun to follow machine learning paradigms, in many cases deep learning specifically. This paradigm shift offers improvements in established areas such as structure or binding prediction and opens up new possibilities such as language-based modeling of antibody repertoires or machine-learning-based generation of novel sequences. In this review, we critically examine the recent developments in (deep) machine learning approaches to therapeutic antibody design with implications for fully computational antibody design.

Title = SYNBIP: synthetic binding proteins for research, diagnosis and therapy

The success of protein engineering and design has extensively expanded the protein space, which presents a promising strategy for creating next-generation proteins of diverse functions. Among these proteins, the synthetic binding proteins (SBPs) are smaller, more stable, less immunogenic, and better of tissue penetration than others, which make the SBP-related data attracting extensive interest from worldwide scientists. However, no database has been developed to systematically provide the valuable information of SBPs yet. In this study, a database named ‘Synthetic Binding Proteins for Research, Diagnosis, and Therapy (SYNBIP)’ was thus introduced. This database is unique in (a) comprehensively describing thousands of SBPs from the perspectives of scaffolds, biophysical & functional properties, etc.; (b) panoramically illustrating the binding targets & the broad application of each SBP and (c) enabling a similarity search against the sequences of all SBPs and their binding targets. Since SBP is a human-made protein that has not been found in nature, the discovery of novel SBPs relied heavily on experimental protein engineering and could be greatly facilitated by in-silico studies (such as AI and computational modeling). Thus, the data provided in SYNBIP could lay a solid foundation for the future development of novel SBPs. The SYNBIP is accessible without login requirement at both official (https://idrblab.org/synbip/) and mirror (http://synbip.idrblab.net/) sites.

Title = Inhibition of Viral Membrane Fusion by Peptides and Approaches to Peptide Design

Fusion of lipid-enveloped viruses with the cellular plasma membrane or the endosome membrane is mediated by viral envelope proteins that undergo large conformational changes following binding to receptors. The HIV-1 fusion protein gp41 undergoes a transition into a “six-helix bundle” after binding of the surface protein gp120 to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor. Synthetic peptides that mimic part of this structure interfere with the formation of the helix structure and inhibit membrane fusion. This approach also works with the S spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here we review the peptide inhibitors of membrane fusion involved in infection by influenza virus, HIV-1, MERS and SARS coronaviruses, hepatitis viruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, herpesviruses and filoviruses. We also describe recent computational methods used for the identification of peptide sequences that can interact strongly with protein interfaces, with special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2, using the PePI-Covid19 database.

Title = Current advances in biopharmaceutical informatics: guidelines, impact and challenges in the computational developability assessment of antibody therapeutics

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives are key components of clinical pipelines in the global biopharmaceutical industry. The availability of large datasets of antibody sequences, structures, and biophysical properties is increasingly enabling the development of predictive models and computational tools for the “developability assessment” of antibody drug candidates. Here, we provide an overview of the antibody informatics tools applicable to the prediction of developability issues such as stability, aggregation, immunogenicity, and chemical degradation. We further evaluate the opportunities and challenges of using biopharmaceutical informatics for drug discovery and optimization. Finally, we discuss the potential of developability guidelines based on in silico metrics that can be used for the assessment of antibody stability and manufacturability.

Title = Deep learning of protein sequence design of protein–protein interactions

As more data of experimentally determined protein structures are becoming available, data-driven models to describe protein sequence–structure relationships become more feasible. Within this space, the amino acid sequence design of protein–protein interactions is still a rather challenging subproblem with very low success rates—yet, it is central to most biological processes.

We developed an attention-based deep learning model inspired by algorithms used for image-caption assignments to design peptides or protein fragment sequences. Our trained model can be applied for the redesign of natural protein interfaces or the designed protein interaction fragments. Here, we validate the potential by recapitulating naturally occurring protein–protein interactions including antibody–antigen complexes. The designed interfaces accurately capture essential native interactions and have comparable native-like binding affinities in silico. Furthermore, our model does not need a precise backbone location, making it an attractive tool for working with de novo design of protein–protein interactions.

Title = The MIDAS domain of AAA mechanoenzyme Mdn1 forms catch bonds with two different substrates

Catch bonds are a form of mechanoregulation wherein protein-ligand interactions are strengthened by the application of dissociative tension. Currently, the best-characterized examples of catch bonds are between single protein-ligand pairs. The essential AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) mechanoenzyme Mdn1 drives at least two separate steps in ribosome biogenesis, using its MIDAS domain to extract the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-containing proteins Rsa4 and Ytm1 from ribosomal precursors. However, it must subsequently release these assembly factors to reinitiate the enzymatic cycle. The mechanism underlying the switching of the MIDAS-UBL interaction between strongly and weakly bound states is unknown. Here, we use optical tweezers to investigate the force dependence of MIDAS-UBL binding. Parallel experiments with Rsa4 and Ytm1 show that forces up to ~4 pN, matching the magnitude of force produced by AAA proteins similar to Mdn1, enhance the MIDAS domain binding lifetime up to 10-fold, and higher forces accelerate dissociation. Together, our studies indicate that Mdn1’s MIDAS domain can form catch bonds with more than one UBL substrate, and provide insights into how mechanoregulation may contribute to the Mdn1 enzymatic cycle during ribosome biogenesis.

Title = Development of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of diseases

Since the first monoclonal antibody drug, muromonab-CD3, was approved for marketing in 1986, 165 antibody drugs have been approved or are under regulatory review worldwide. With the approval of new drugs for treating a wide range of diseases, including cancer and autoimmune and metabolic disorders, the therapeutic antibody drug market has experienced explosive growth. Monoclonal antibodies have been sought after by many biopharmaceutical companies and scientific research institutes due to their high specificity, strong targeting abilities, low toxicity, side effects, and high development success rate. The related industries and markets are growing rapidly, and therapeutic antibodies are one of the most important research and development areas in the field of biology and medicine. In recent years, great progress has been made in the key technologies and theoretical innovations provided by therapeutic antibodies, including antibody–drug conjugates, antibody-conjugated nuclides, bispecific antibodies, nanobodies, and other antibody analogs. Additionally, therapeutic antibodies can be combined with technologies used in other fields to create new cross-fields, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), CAR-natural killer cells (CAR-NK), and other cell therapy. This review summarizes the latest approved or in regulatory review therapeutic antibodies that have been approved or that are under regulatory review worldwide, as well as clinical research on these approaches and their development, and outlines antibody discovery strategies that have emerged during the development of therapeutic antibodies, such as hybridoma technology, phage display, preparation of fully human antibody from transgenic mice, single B-cell antibody technology, and artificial intelligence-assisted antibody discovery.

Title = Studying the characteristics of nanobody CDR regions based on sequence analysis in combination with 3D structures

Single-domain antibodies or nanobodies have recently attracted much attention in research and applications because of their great potential and advantage over conventional antibodies. However, isolation of candidate nanobodies in the lab has been costly and time-consuming. Screening of leading nanobody candidates through synthetic libraries is a promising alternative, but it requires prior knowledge to control the diversity of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) while still maintaining functionality. In this work, we identified sequence characteristics that could contribute to nanobody functionality by analyzing three datasets, CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3.

By classification of amino acids based on physicochemical properties, we found that two different amino acid groups were sufficient for CDRs. The nonpolar group accounted for half of the total amino acid composition in these sequences. Observation of the highest occurrence of each amino acid revealed that the usage of some important amino acids such as tyrosine and serine was highly correlated with the length of the CDR3. Amino acid repeat motifs were also under-represented and highly restricted as 3-mers. Inspecting the crystallographic data also demonstrated conservation in structural coordinates of dominant amino acids such as methionine, isoleucine, valine, threonine, and tyrosine and certain positions in the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 sequences.

We identified sequence characteristics that contributed to functional nanobodies including amino acid groups, the occurrence of each kind of amino acids, and repeat patterns. These results provide a simple set of rules to make it easier to generate desired candidates by computational means; also, they can be used as a reference to evaluate synthetic nanobodies.

Title = ESAT-6 undergoes self-association at phagosomal pH and an ESAT-6-specific nanobody restricts M. tuberculosis growth in macrophages

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is known to survive within macrophages by compromising the integrity of the phagosomal compartment in which it resides. This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6’s mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH-dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.

Title = A Nanobody of PEDV S1 Protein: Screening and Expression in Escherichia coli

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused significant economic losses to the pig farming industry in various countries for a long time. Currently, there are no highly effective preventive or control measures available. Research into the pathogenic mechanism of PEDV has shown that it primarily causes infection by binding the S protein to the CD13 (APN) receptor on the membrane of porcine intestinal epithelial cells. The S1 region contains three neutralization epitopes and multiple receptor-binding domains, which are closely related to viral antigenicity and ad-sorption invasion. Nanobodies are a type of single-domain antibody that have been discovered in recent years. They can be expressed on a large scale through prokaryotic expression systems, which makes them cost-effective, stable, and less immunogenic. This study used a phage display library of nanobodies against the PEDV S1 protein. After three rounds of selection and enrichment, the DNA sequence of the highly specific nanobody S1Nb1 was successfully obtained. To obtain soluble nanobody S1Nb1, its DNA sequence was inserted into the vector Pcold and a solubility-enhancing SUMO tag was added. The resulting recombinant vector, Pcold-SUMO-S1Nb1, was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to determine the optimal expression conditions for the nanobody. Following purification using Ni-column affinity chromatography, Western blot analysis confirmed the successful purification of S1Nb1 carrying the solubility-enhancing tag. ELISA results demonstrated a strong affinity between the S1Nb1 nanobody and PEDV S1 protein.

Title = NanoNet: Rapid and accurate end-to-end nanobody modeling by deep learning

Antibodies are a rapidly growing class of therapeutics. Recently, single domain camelid VHH antibodies, and their recognition nanobody domain (Nb) appeared as a cost-effective highly stable alternative to full-length antibodies. There is a growing need for high-throughput epitope mapping based on accurate structural modeling of the variable domains that share a common fold and differ in the Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs). We develop a deep learning end-to-end model, NanoNet, that given a sequence directly produces the 3D coordinates of the backbone and Cβ atoms of the entire VH domain. For the Nb test set, NanoNet achieves 3.16Å average RMSD for the most variable CDR3 loops and 2.65Å, 1.73Å for the CDR1, CDR2 loops, respectively. The accuracy for antibody VH domains is even higher: 2.38Å RMSD for CDR3 and 0.89Å, 0.96Å for the CDR1, CDR2 loops, respectively. NanoNet run times allow generation of ∼1M nanobody structures in less than 4 hours on a standard CPU computer enabling high-throughput structure modeling. NanoNet is available at GitHub:

Title = Identification of Inhibitors of the Disease-Associated Protein Phosphatase Scp1 Using Antibody Mimetic Molecules

Protein phosphorylation is a prevalent translational modification, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer. Despite its significance, there is a lack of specific inhibitors of the FCP/SCP-type Ser/Thr protein phosphatase Scp1, characterized by high specificity and affinity. In this study, we focused on adnectin, an antibody-mimetic protein, aiming to identify Scp1-specific binding molecules with a broad binding surface that target the substrate-recognition site of Scp1. Biopanning of Scp1 was performed using an adnectin-presenting phage library with a randomized FG loop. We succeeded in identifying FG-1Adn, which showed high affinity and specificity for Scp1. Ala scanning analysis of the Scp1-binding sequence in relation to the FG-1 peptide revealed that hydrophobic residues, including aromatic amino acids, play important roles in Scp1 recognition. Furthermore, FG-1Adn was found to co-localize with Scp1 in cells, especially on the plasma membrane. In addition, Western blotting analysis showed that FG-1Adn increased the phosphorylation level of the target protein of Scp1 in cells, indicating that FG-1Adn can inhibit the function of Scp1. These results suggest that FG-1Adn can be used as a specific inhibitor of Scp1.

Title = Segmentation strategy of de novo designed four-helical bundles expands protein oligomerization modalities for cell regulation

Protein–protein interactions govern most biological processes. New protein assemblies can be introduced through the fusion of selected proteins with di/oligomerization domains, which interact specifically with their partners but not with other cellular proteins. While four-helical bundle proteins (4HB) have typically been assembled from two segments, each comprising two helices, here we show that they can be efficiently segmented in various ways, expanding the number of combinations generated from a single 4HB. We implement a segmentation strategy of 4HB to design two-, three-, or four-chain combinations for the recruitment of multiple protein components. Different segmentations provide new insight into the role of individual helices for 4HB assembly. We evaluate 4HB segmentations for potential use in mammalian cells for the reconstitution of a protein reporter, transcriptional activation, and inducible 4HB assembly. Furthermore, the implementation of trimerization is demonstrated as a modular chimeric antigen receptor for the recognition of multiple cancer antigens.

New protein assemblies can be introduced through the fusion of selected proteins with di/oligomerization domains, which interact specifically with their partners but not with other cellular proteins. Here the authors demonstrate that a single four-helical bundle protein can be segmented into several different parts, defining up to four interacting molecules for enzyme reconstitution, gene expression, or CAR-T cell regulation.

Title = Protein Design: From the Aspect of Water Solubility and Stability

Water solubility and structural stability are key merits for proteins defined by the primary sequence and 3D-conformation. Their manipulation represents important aspects of the protein design field that relies on the accurate placement of amino acids and molecular interactions, guided by underlying physiochemical principles. Emulated designer proteins with well-defined properties both fuel the knowledge-base for more precise computational design models and are used in various biomedical and nanotechnological applications. The continuous developments in protein science, increasing computing power, new algorithms, and characterization techniques provide sophisticated toolkits for solubility design beyond guess work. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the protein design field with respect to water solubility and structural stability. After introducing fundamental design rules, we discuss the transmembrane protein solubilization and de novo transmembrane protein design. Traditional strategies to enhance protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The designs of stable protein complexes and high-order assemblies are covered. Computational methodologies behind these endeavors, including structure prediction programs, machine learning algorithms, and specialty software dedicated to the evaluation of protein solubility and aggregation, are discussed. The findings and opportunities for Cryo-EM are presented. This review provides an overview of significant progress and prospects in accurate protein design for solubility and stability.

Title = Crystal structure of the α1B-adrenergic receptor reveals molecular determinants of selective ligand recognition

α-adrenergic receptors (αARs) are G protein-coupled receptors that regulate vital functions of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The therapeutic potential of αARs, however, is largely unexploited and hampered by the scarcity of subtype-selective ligands. Moreover, several aminergic drugs either show off-target binding to αARs or fail to interact with the desired subtype. Here, we report the crystal structure of human α1BAR bound to the inverse agonist (+)-cyclazosin, enabled by the fusion to a DARPin crystallization chaperone. The α1BAR structure allows the identification of two unique secondary binding pockets. By structural comparison of α1BAR with α2ARs, and by constructing α1BAR-α2CAR chimeras, we identify residues 3.29 and 6.55 as key determinants of ligand selectivity. Our findings provide a basis for discovery of α1BAR-selective ligands and may guide the optimization of aminergic drugs to prevent off-target binding to αARs, or to elicit a selective interaction with the desired subtype.

This study reports the X-ray structure of the α1B-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor bound to an inverse agonist, and unveils key determinants of subtype-selective ligand binding that may help the design of aminergic drugs with fewer side-effects.

Title = De novo design of protein structure and function with RFdiffusion

There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.

Fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks yields a generative model for protein design that achieves outstanding performance on a wide range of protein structure and function design challenges.

Structure‐based computational approaches have emerged as indispensable tools in the rational design of those molecules, enabling the precise manipulation of their structural and functional properties. This review covers the main classes of designed antigen‐binding motifs, as well as alternative strategies to develop tailored ones. We discuss the intricacies of different computational protein–protein interaction design strategies, showcased by selected successful cases in the literature. Subsequently, we explore the latest advancements in the computational techniques including the integration of machine and deep learning methodologies into the design framework, which has led to an augmented design pipeline. Finally, we verse onto the current challenges that stand in the way between high‐throughput computer design of antibody mimetics and experimental realization, offering a forward‐looking perspective into the field and the promises it holds to biotechnology.

Title = Progress and challenges for the machine learning-based design of fit-for-purpose monoclonal antibodies

Although the therapeutic efficacy and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are tremendous, the design and discovery of new candidates remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor. In this regard, progress in the generation of data describing antigen binding and developability, computational methodology, and artificial intelligence may pave the way for a new era of in silico on-demand immunotherapeutics design and discovery. Here, we argue that the main necessary machine learning (ML) components for an in silico mAb sequence generator are: understanding of the rules of mAb-antigen binding, capacity to modularly combine mAb design parameters, and algorithms for unconstrained parameter-driven in silico mAb sequence synthesis. We review the current progress toward the realization of these necessary components and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to allow the on-demand ML-based discovery and design of fit-for-purpose mAb therapeutic candidates.

Title = Fast, accurate antibody structure prediction from deep learning on massive set of natural antibodies

Antibodies have the capacity to bind a diverse set of antigens, and they have become critical therapeutics and diagnostic molecules. The binding of antibodies is facilitated by a set of six hypervariable loops that are diversified through genetic recombination and mutation. Even with recent advances, accurate structural prediction of these loops remains a challenge. Here, we present IgFold, a fast deep learning method for antibody structure prediction. IgFold consists of a pre-trained language model trained on 558 million natural antibody sequences followed by graph networks that directly predict backbone atom coordinates. IgFold predicts structures of similar or better quality than alternative methods (including AlphaFold) in significantly less time (under 25 s). Accurate structure prediction on this timescale makes possible avenues of investigation that were previously infeasible. As a demonstration of IgFold’s capabilities, we predicted structures for 1.4 million paired antibody sequences, providing structural insights to 500-fold more antibodies than have experimentally determined structures.

Prediction of antibody structures is critical for understanding and designing novel therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Here, the authors present IgFold: a fast, accurate method for antibody structure prediction using an end-to-end deep learning model.

Researchers have devised novel techniques to streamline antibody development, combining in vitro and in silico methods. In particular, computational power expedites lead candidate generation, scaling and potential antibody development against complex antigens. This survey highlights significant advancements in protein design and optimization, specifically focusing on antibodies. This includes various aspects such as design, folding, antibody–antigen interactions docking and affinity maturation.

Title = Epitope mapping via in vitro deep mutational scanning methods and its applications

Epitope mapping is a technique employed to define the region of an antigen that elicits an immune response, providing crucial insight into the structural architecture of the antigen as well as epitope-paratope interactions. With this breadth of knowledge, immunotherapies, diagnostics, and vaccines are being developed with a rational and data-supported design. Traditional epitope mapping methods are laborious, time-intensive, and often lack the ability to screen proteins in a high-throughput manner or provide high resolution. Deep mutational scanning (DMS), however, is revolutionizing the field as it can screen all possible single amino acid mutations and provide an efficient and high-throughput way to infer the structures of both linear and three-dimensional epitopes with high resolution. Currently, more than 50 publications take this approach to efficiently identify enhancing or escaping mutations, with many then employing this information to rapidly develop broadly neutralizing antibodies, T-cell immunotherapies, vaccine platforms, or diagnostics. We provide a comprehensive review of the approaches to accomplish epitope mapping while also providing a summation of the development of DMS technology and its impactful applications.

Title = Enhancing antibody affinity through experimental sampling of non-deleterious CDR mutations predicted by machine learning

The application of machine learning (ML) models to optimize antibody affinity to an antigen is gaining prominence. Unfortunately, the small and biased nature of the publicly available antibody-antigen interaction datasets makes it challenging to build an ML model that can accurately predict binding affinity changes due to mutations (ΔΔG). Recognizing these inherent limitations, we reformulated the problem to ask whether an ML model capable of classifying deleterious vs non-deleterious mutations can guide antibody affinity maturation in a practical setting. To test this hypothesis, we developed a Random Forest classifier (Antibody Random Forest Classifier or AbRFC) with expert-guided features and integrated it into a computational-experimental workflow. AbRFC effectively predicted non-deleterious mutations on an in-house validation dataset that is free of biases seen in the publicly available training datasets. Furthermore, experimental screening of a limited number of predictions from the model (<10^2 designs) identified affinity-enhancing mutations in two unrelated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, resulting in constructs with up to 1000-fold increased binding to the SARS-COV-2 RBD. Our findings indicate that accurate prediction and screening of non-deleterious mutations using machine learning offers a powerful approach to improving antibody affinity.

The endeavor to harness machine learning to improve antibody-antigen interaction is not only significant but also fraught with challenges due to the limitations of the publicly available datasets. Here, the authors introduce an Antibody Random Forest Classifier that classifies mutations as either deleterious or non-deleterious based on physicochemical features, which enabled the identification of affinity-enhancing mutations in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with an up to 1000-fold increased binding affinity.

Title = AI-based IsAb2.0 for antibody design

Therapeutic antibody design has garnered widespread attention, highlighting its interdisciplinary importance. Advancements in technology emphasize the critical role of designing nanobodies and humanized antibodies in antibody engineering. However, current experimental methods are costly and time-consuming. Computational approaches, while progressing, faced limitations due to insufficient structural data and the absence of a standardized protocol. To tackle these challenges, our lab previously developed IsAb1.0, an in silico antibody design protocol. Yet, IsAb1.0 lacked accuracy, had a complex procedure, and required extensive antibody bioinformation. Moreover, it overlooked nanobody and humanized antibody design, hindering therapeutic antibody development. Building upon IsAb1.0, we enhanced our design protocol with artificial intelligence methods to create IsAb2.0. IsAb2.0 utilized AlphaFold-Multimer (2.3/3.0) for accurate modeling and complex construction without templates and employed the precise FlexddG method for in silico antibody optimization. Validated through optimization of a humanized nanobody J3 (HuJ3) targeting HIV-1 gp120, IsAb2.0 predicted five mutations that can improve HuJ3-gp120 binding affinity. These predictions were confirmed by commercial software and validated through binding and neutralization assays. IsAb2.0 streamlined antibody design, offering insights into future techniques to accelerate immunotherapy development.

Title = Insights on the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant

The SARS-COV2 Omicron variant has sparked global concern due to the possibility of enhanced transmissibility and escape from vaccines and therapeutics. In this study, we describe the mutational landscape of the Omicron variant using amino acid interaction (AAI) networks. AAI network analysis is particularly well suited for interrogating the impact of constellations of mutations as occur on Omicron that may function in an epistatic manner. Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape breadth due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape depth due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicron’s escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations with relevance for certain therapeutic antibodies. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation. Finally, for several Omicron mutations that do not appear to contribute meaningfully to antibody escape, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBD-RBD interface.

Title = Quantum leap of monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovery and development in the COVID-19 era

In recent years the global market for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) became a multi-billion-dollar business. This success is mainly driven by treatments in the oncology and autoimmune space. Instead, development of effective mAbs against infectious diseases has been lagging behind. For years the high production cost and limited efficacy have blocked broader application of mAbs in the infectious disease space, which instead has been dominated for almost a century by effective and cheap antibiotics and vaccines. Only very few mAbs against RSV, anthrax, Clostridium difficile or rabies have reached the market. This is about to change. The development of urgently needed and highly effective mAbs as preventive and therapeutic treatments against a variety of pathogens is gaining traction. Vast advances in mAb isolation, engineering and production have entirely shifted the cost-efficacy balance. MAbs against devastating diseases like Ebola, HIV and other complex pathogens are now within reach. This trend is further accelerated by ongoing or imminent health crises like COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibodies could be the last resort. In this review we will retrace the history of antibodies from the times of serum therapy to modern mAbs and lay out how the current run for effective treatments against COVID-19 will lead to a quantum leap in scientific, technological and health care system innovation around mAb treatments for infectious diseases.

Title = Recent Progress in the Discovery and Development of Monoclonal Antibodies against Viral Infections

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the new revolutionary class of medications, are fast becoming tools against various diseases thanks to a unique structure and function that allow them to bind highly specific targets or receptors. These specialized proteins can be produced in large quantities via the hybridoma technique introduced in 1975 or by means of modern technologies. Additional methods have been developed to generate mAbs with new biological properties such as humanized, chimeric, or murine. The inclusion of mAbs in therapeutic regimens is a major medical advance and will hopefully lead to significant improvements in infectious disease management. Since the first therapeutic mAb, muromonab-CD3, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986, the list of approved mAbs and their clinical indications and applications have been proliferating. New technologies have been developed to modify the structure of mAbs, thereby increasing efficacy and improving delivery routes. Gene delivery technologies, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors (DMabs or mRNA-encoded mAbs), built to express tailored mAb genes, might help overcome some of the challenges of mAb therapy, including production restrictions, cold-chain storage, transportation requirements, and expensive manufacturing and distribution processes. This paper reviews some of the recent developments in mAb discovery against viral infections and illustrates how mAbs can help to combat viral diseases and outbreaks.

Title = Structural Modeling of Nanobodies: A Benchmark of State-of-the-Art Artificial Intelligence Programs

The number of applications for nanobodies is steadily expanding, positioning these molecules as fast-growing biologic products in the biotechnology market. Several of their applications require protein engineering, which in turn would greatly benefit from having a reliable structural model of the nanobody of interest. However, as with antibodies, the structural modeling of nanobodies is still a challenge. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), several methods have been developed in recent years that attempt to solve the problem of protein modeling. In this study, we have compared the performance in nanobody modeling of several state-of-the-art AI-based programs, either designed for general protein modeling, such as AlphaFold2, OmegaFold, ESMFold, and Yang-Server, or specifically designed for antibody modeling, such as IgFold, and Nanonet. While all these programs performed rather well in constructing the nanobody framework and CDRs 1 and 2, modeling CDR3 still represents a big challenge. Interestingly, tailoring an AI method for antibody modeling does not necessarily translate into better results for nanobodies.

Title = A pan-KRAS degrader for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers

KRAS mutations are highly prevalent in a wide range of lethal cancers, and these mutant forms of KRAS play a crucial role in driving cancer progression and conferring resistance to treatment. While there have been advancements in the development of small molecules to target specific KRAS mutants, the presence of undruggable mutants and the emergence of secondary mutations continue to pose challenges in the clinical treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers. In this study, we developed a novel molecular tool called tumor-targeting KRAS degrader (TKD) that effectively targets a wide range of KRAS mutants. TKD is composed of a KRAS-binding nanobody, a cell-penetrating peptide selectively targeting cancer cells, and a lysosome-binding motif. Our data revealed that TKD selectively binds to KRAS in cancer cells and effectively induces KRAS degradation via a lysosome-dependent process. Functionally, TKD suppresses tumor growth with no obvious side effects and enhances the antitumor effects of PD-1 antibody and cetuximab. This study not only provides a strategy for developing drugs targeting “undruggable” proteins but also reveals that TKD is a promising therapeutic for treating KRAS-mutant cancers.

Title = Design of facilitated dissociation enables control over cytokine signaling duration

Protein design has focused primarily on the design of ground states, ensuring they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke to generate a structurally frustrated and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.

Title = Computationally designed sensors detect endogenous Ras activity and signaling effectors at subcellular resolution

The utility of genetically encoded biosensors for sensing the activity of signaling proteins has been hampered by a lack of strategies for matching sensor sensitivity to the physiological concentration range of the target. Here we used computational protein design to generate intracellular sensors of Ras activity (LOCKR-based Sensor for Ras activity (Ras-LOCKR-S)) and proximity labelers of the Ras signaling environment (LOCKR-based, Ras activity-dependent Proximity Labeler (Ras-LOCKR-PL)). These tools allow the detection of endogenous Ras activity and labeling of the surrounding environment at subcellular resolution. Using these sensors in human cancer cell lines, we identified Ras-interacting proteins in oncogenic EML4-Alk granules and found that Src-Associated in Mitosis 68-kDa (SAM68) protein specifically enhances Ras activity in the granules. The ability to subcellularly localize endogenous Ras activity should deepen our understanding of Ras function in health and disease and may suggest potential therapeutic strategies.

Computationally designed sensors map the activity and signaling environment of Ras.

Title = A comprehensive overview of recent advances in generative models for antibodies

Therapeutic antibodies are an important class of biopharmaceuticals. With the rapid development of deep learning methods and the increasing amount of antibody data, antibody generative models have made great progress recently. They aim to solve the antibody space searching problems and are widely incorporated into the antibody development process. Therefore, a comprehensive introduction to the development methods in this field is imperative. Here, we collected 34 representative antibody generative models published recently and all generative models can be divided into three categories: sequence-generating models, structure-generating models, and hybrid models, based on their principles and algorithms. We further studied their performance and contributions to antibody sequence prediction, structure optimization, and affinity enhancement. Our manuscript will provide a comprehensive overview of the status of antibody generative models and also offer guidance for selecting different approaches.
