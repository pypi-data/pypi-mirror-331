Although pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV lead to severe respiratory infections, how these viruses affect the chromatin proteomic composition upon infection remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we use our recently developed integrative DNA And Protein Tagging methodology to identify changes in host chromatin accessibility states and chromatin proteomic composition upon infection with pathogenic coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces TP53 stabilization on chromatin, which contributes to its host cytopathic effect. We mapped this TP53 stabilization to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and its propensity to form syncytia, a consequence of cell-cell fusion. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 spike variant-induced syncytia formation modify chromatin accessibility, cellular senescence, and inflammatory cytokine release via TP53. Our findings suggest that differences in syncytia formation alter senescence-associated inflammation, which varies among SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nLee et al. find that spike-mediated cell-cell fusion triggers TP53 stabilization, chromatin accessibility changes, and activation of senescence. The extent of these effects differs based on the fusogenicity of various SARS-CoV-2 variant spike sequences.\n\n[end paper 1]\n\n[begin paper 2]\n\nPMCID = 10661752\n\nTitle = Infection and Vaccine Induced Spike Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in COVID-19-Na\u00efve Children and Adults\n\nAlthough a more efficient adaptive humoral immune response has been proposed to underlie the usually favorable outcome of pediatric COVID-19, the breadth of viral and vaccine cross-reactivity toward the ever-mutating Spike protein among variants of concern (VOCs) has not yet been compared between children and adults. We assessed antibodies to conformational Spike in COVID-19-na\u00efve children and adults vaccinated by BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, and naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 Early Clade, Delta, and Omicron. Sera were analyzed against Spike including naturally occurring VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1.1, BA2.75.2, and XBB.1, and variants of interest Epsilon, Kappa, Eta, D.2, and artificial mutant Spikes. There was no notable difference between breadth and longevity of antibody against VOCs in children and adults. Vaccinated individuals displayed similar immunoreactivity profiles across variants compared with naturally infected individuals. Delta-infected patients had an enhanced cross-reactivity toward Delta and earlier VOCs compared to patients infected by Early Clade SARS-CoV-2. Although Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1.1, BA2.75.2, and XBB.1 antibody titers were generated after Omicron infection, cross-reactive binding against Omicron subvariants was reduced across all infection, immunization, and age groups. Some mutations, such as 498R and 501Y, epistatically combined to enhance cross-reactive binding, but could not fully compensate for antibody-evasive mutations within the Omicron subvariants tested. Our results reveal important molecular features central to the generation of high antibody titers and broad immunoreactivity that should be considered in future vaccine design and global serosurveillance in the context of limited vaccine boosters available to the pediatric population.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10875-023-01540-5.\n\n[end paper 2]\n\n[begin paper 3]\n\nPMCID = 10356814\n\nTitle = Identifying and profiling structural similarities between Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral or host proteins with Machaon\n\nUsing protein structure to predict function, interactions, and evolutionary history is still an open challenge, with existing approaches relying extensively on protein homology and families. Here, we present Machaon, a data-driven method combining orientation invariant metrics on phi-psi angles, inter-residue contacts and surface complexity. It can be readily applied on whole structures or segments\u2014such as domains and binding sites. Machaon was applied on SARS-CoV-2 Spike monomers of native, Delta and Omicron variants and identified correlations with a wide range of viral proteins from close to distant taxonomy ranks, as well as host proteins, such as ACE2 receptor. Machaon\u2019s meta-analysis of the results highlights structural, chemical and transcriptional similarities between the Spike monomer and human proteins, indicating a multi-level viral mimicry. This extended analysis also revealed relationships of the Spike protein\u00a0with biological processes such as ubiquitination and angiogenesis and highlighted different patterns in virus attachment among the studied variants.

The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBDSpike). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study, we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBDSpike which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBDSpike is an independently foldable protein domain, resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly, in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity), the RBDSpike\u2013ACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBDSpike has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, attributed to key evolutionary changes, making it inherently \u201creaction-prone.\u201d The designed mimics aimed to block the viral entry by occupying the available binding sites on ACE2, are tested to have signatures of stable high-affinity binding with ACE2 (cross-validated by appropriate free energy estimates), overriding the native quasi-stable feature. The results show the apt of directly adapting natural examples in rational protein design, wherein, homology-based threading coupled with strategic \u201chydrophobic \u2194 polar\u201d mutations serve as a potential breakthrough.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00894-021-04779-0.\n\n[end paper 4]\n\n[begin paper 5]\n\nPMCID = 7577648\n\nTitle = Human Hematopoietic Stem, Progenitor, and Immune Cells Respond Ex Vivo to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein\n\nDespite evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is systemic in nature, there is little known about the effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure has on many host cell types, including primitive and mature hematopoietic cells. The hematopoietic system is responsible for giving rise to the very immune cells that defend against viral infection and is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) which are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to treat hematologic disorders, thus there is a strong need to understand how exposure to the virus may affect hematopoietic cell functions. We examined the expression of ACE2, to which SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to facilitate viral entry, in cord blood derived HSCs/HPCs and in peripheral blood derived immune cell subtypes. ACE2 is expressed in low numbers of immune cells, higher numbers of HPCs, and up to 65% of rigorously defined HSCs. We also examined effects of exposing HSCs/HPCs and immune cells to SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S protein ex vivo. HSCs and HPCs expand less effectively and have less functional colony forming capacity when grown with S protein, while peripheral blood monocytes upregulate CD14 expression and show distinct changes in size and granularity. That these effects are induced by recombinant S protein alone and not the infectious viral particle suggests that simple exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may impact HSCs/HPCs and immune cells via S protein interactions with the cells, regardless of whether they can be infected. These data have implications for immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and for HCT.\n\n\u2022 Human HSCs, HPCs, and immune cells express ACE2 on the cell surface, making them potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\u2022 SARS-CoV-2\u00a0S protein, which binds to ACE2, induces defects in the colony forming capacity of human HPC and inhibits the expansion of HSC/HPC subpopulations\u00a0ex vivo. These effects can be at least partially neutralized by treatment with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibody, recombinant human ACE2, or Angiotensin1\u20137.\n\n\u2022 S protein also induces aberrant morphological changes in peripheral blood derived monocytes ex vivo.\n\n\u2022 Thus, there are many different manners in which SARS-CoV-2 virus may impact the functional hematopoietic system, which has important implications for hematological manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e. thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia), immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the era of COVID-19.\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s12015-020-10056-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n[end paper 5]\n\n[begin paper 6]\n\nPMCID = 10831124\n\nTitle = Binding affinity between coronavirus spike protein and human ACE2 receptor\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) pose a major risk to global public health due to their ability to infect diverse animal species and potential for emergence in humans. The CoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the cell and plays a crucial role in determining the binding affinity to host cell receptors. With particular emphasis on \u03b1- and \u03b2-coronaviruses that infect humans and domestic animals, current research on CoV receptor use suggests that the exploitation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor poses a significant threat for viral emergence with pandemic potential. This review summarizes the approaches used to study binding interactions between CoV spike proteins and the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Solid-phase enzyme immunoassays and cell binding assays allow qualitative assessment of binding but lack quantitative evaluation of affinity. Surface plasmon resonance, Bio-layer interferometry, and Microscale Thermophoresis on the other hand, provide accurate affinity measurement through equilibrium dissociation constants (KD). In silico modeling predicts affinity through binding structure modeling, protein-protein docking simulations, and binding energy calculations but reveals inconsistent results due to the lack of a standardized approach. Machine learning and deep learning models utilize simulated and experimental protein-protein interaction data to elucidate the critical residues associated with CoV binding affinity to hACE2. Further optimization and standardization of existing approaches for studying binding affinity could aid pandemic preparedness. Specifically, prioritizing surveillance of CoVs that can bind to human receptors stands to mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover.\n\n[end paper 6]\n\n[begin paper 7]\n\nPMCID = 10247271\n\nTitle = Wastewater early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and variants in a Coru\u00f1a, Spain\n\nWastewater-based epidemiology has been widely used as a cost-effective method for tracking the COVID-19 pandemic at the community level. Here we describe COVIDBENS, a wastewater surveillance program running from June 2020 to March 2022 in the wastewater treatment plant of Bens in A Coru\u00f1a (Spain). The main goal of this work was to provide an effective early warning tool based in wastewater epidemiology to help in decision-making at both the social and public health levels. RT-qPCR procedures and Illumina sequencing were used to weekly monitor the viral load and to detect SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater, respectively. In addition, own statistical models were applied to estimate the real number of infected people and the frequency of each emerging variant circulating in the community, which considerable improved the surveillance strategy. Our analysis detected 6 viral load waves in A Coru\u00f1a with concentrations between 103 and 106 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/L. Our system was able to anticipate community outbreaks during the pandemic with 8\u201336\u00a0days in advance with respect to clinical reports and, to detect the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in A Coru\u00f1a such as Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA.2) in wastewater with 42, 30, and 27\u00a0days, respectively, before the health system did. Data generated here helped local authorities and health managers to give a faster and more efficient response to the pandemic situation, and also allowed important industrial companies to adapt their production to each situation. The wastewater-based epidemiology program developed in our metropolitan area of A Coru\u00f1a (Spain) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic served as a powerful early warning system combining statistical models with mutations and viral load monitoring in wastewater over time.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11356-023-27877-3.\n\n[end paper 7]\n\n[begin paper 8]\n\nPMCID = 11316817\n\nTitle = De novo generation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody CDRH3 with a pre-trained generative large language model\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have made great advances in assisting antibody design. However, antibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a Pre-trained Antibody generative large Language Model (PALM-H3) for the de novo generation of artificial antibodies heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) with desired antigen-binding specificity, reducing the reliance on natural antibodies. We also build a high-precision model antigen-antibody binder (A2binder) that pairs antigen epitope sequences with antibody sequences to predict binding specificity and affinity. PALM-H3-generated antibodies exhibit binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the emerging XBB variant, as confirmed through in-silico analysis and in-vitro assays. The in-vitro assays validate that PALM-H3-generated antibodies achieve high binding affinity and potent neutralization capability against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and the emerging XBB variant. Meanwhile, A2binder demonstrates exceptional predictive performance on binding specificity for various epitopes and variants. Furthermore, by incorporating the attention mechanism inherent in the Roformer architecture into the PALM-H3 model, we improve its interpretability, providing crucial insights into the fundamental principles of antibody design.\n\nAntibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum.

This race aims to find, by various means, weapons to counter the Covid-19 pandemic now widespread on all continents. The aquatic world and in particular that of photosynthetic organisms is regularly highlighted but paradoxically little exploited in view of the tremendous possibilities it offers. Computational tools allow not only to clear the existence and activity of many molecules but also to model their relationships with receptors identified in potential hosts. On a routine basis, our laboratory carries out a research activity on functionalities of molecules derived from algae using in silico tools. We have implemented our skills in algae biology and in modeling, as tests in order to identify molecules expressed by the genus Arthrospira showing an antiviral potential and more particularly anti-SARS-CoV-2. Using consensus docking and redocking with Autodock Vina and SwissDock, we were able to identify several promising molecules from Arthrospira: phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, phycourobilin, and folic acid. These four compounds showed reliable binding energies comprised between \u2212 6.95 and \u2212 7.45 kcal.mol\u22121 in Autodock Vina and between \u2212 9.285 and \u2212 10.35 kcal.mol\u22121 with SwissDock. Toxicity prediction as well as current regulations provided promising arguments for the inclusion of these compounds in further studies to assess their ability to compete with the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10811-021-02372-9.\n\n[end paper 9]\n\n[begin paper 10]\n\nPMCID = 7962425\n\nTitle = Serologic Cross-Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with Endemic and Seasonal Betacoronaviruses\n\nIn order to properly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of humoral immunity, researchers have evaluated the presence of serum antibodies of people worldwide experiencing the pandemic. These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full spike proteins of four other betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10875-021-00997-6.\n\n[end paper 10]\n\n[begin paper 11]\n\nPMCID = 7797355\n\nTitle = ACE-2-interacting Domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) Peptide Suppresses Inflammation to Reduce Fever and Protect Lungs and Heart in Mice: Implications for COVID-19 Therapy\n\nCOVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by the virus strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and until now, there is no effective therapy against COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells, to target COVID-19 from therapeutic angle, we engineered a hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) that inhibits the association between receptor-binding domain-containing spike S1 and ACE-2. Accordingly, wild type (wt), but not mutated (m), AIDS peptide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and expression of IL-6 in human lungs cells. Interestingly, intranasal intoxication of C57/BL6 mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 led to fever, increase in IL-6 in lungs, infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, arrhythmias, and impairment in locomotor activities, mimicking some of the important symptoms of COVID-19. However, intranasal treatment with wtAIDS, but not mAIDS, peptide reduced fever, protected lungs, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of ACE2-to-SARS-CoV-2 interaction by wtAIDS may be beneficial for COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11481-020-09979-8.\n\n[end paper 11]\n\n[begin paper 12]\n\nPMCID = 11751191\n\nTitle = Paying attention to the SARS-CoV-2 dialect : a deep neural network approach to predicting novel protein mutations\n\nPredicting novel mutations has long-lasting impacts on life science research. Traditionally, this problem is addressed through wet-lab experiments, which are often expensive and time consuming. The recent advancement in neural language models has provided stunning results in modeling and deciphering sequences. In this paper, we propose a Deep Novel Mutation Search (DNMS) method, using deep neural networks, to model protein sequence for mutation prediction. We use SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the target and use a protein language model to predict novel mutations. Different from existing research which is often limited to mutating the reference sequence for prediction, we propose a parent-child mutation prediction paradigm where a parent sequence is modeled for mutation prediction. Because mutations introduce changing context to the underlying sequence, DNMS models three aspects of the protein sequences: semantic changes, grammatical changes, and attention changes, each modeling protein sequence aspects from shifting of semantics, grammar coherence, and amino-acid interactions in latent space. A ranking approach is proposed to combine all three aspects to capture mutations demonstrating evolving traits, in accordance with real-world SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence evolution. DNMS can be adopted for an early warning variant detection system, creating public health awareness of future SARS-CoV-2 mutations.\n\nElkin and Zhu\u00a0propose a Deep Novel Mutation Search (DNMS) method, using deep neural networks to model SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence for novel mutation prediction, by calculating semantic change, attention change, and grammaticality of an amino acid sequence to rank all possible substitutions.\n\n[end paper 12]\n\n[begin paper 13]\n\nPMCID = 9486763\n\nTitle = A novel delayed lateral flow immunoassay for enhanced detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen\n\nA new detection strategy was developed to improve the sensitivity of a lateral flow immunoassay platform utilizing a delayed hydrophobic barrier fabricated with trimethylsilyl cellulose (TMSC). The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD) antigen was chosen as a model analyte to demonstrate the superior detectability of this scheme. The novel device consists of 2 separate layers, so-called delayed lateral flow immunoassay (d-LFIA). The upper layer is intended for the analyte or sample flow path, where the test solution flows freely straight to the detection zone to bind with the primary antibody. The lower layer, located just underneath, is designed for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain-conjugated gold nanoparticles (SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD-AuNPs) used for producing a colorimetric signal. This layer is fabricated with a TMSC barrier to time-delay the movement of SARS-CoV-2 SP RBD-AuNPs, thus allowing the antigen to bind with the primary antibody more efficiently. This platform exhibited a 2.6-fold enhancement in the sensitivity and 9.1-fold improvement in the limit of detection (LOD) as compared with the conventional LFIA. In addition, this d-LFIA device was satisfactorily applied to\u00a0accurate screening of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00604-022-05467-3.\n\n[end paper 13]\n\n[begin paper 14]\n\nPMCID = 8805427\n\nTitle = Variable levels of spike and ORF1ab RNA in post-mortem lung samples of SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects: comparison between ISH and RT-PCR\n\nPost-mortem examination plays a pivotal role in understanding the pathobiology of the SARS-CoV-2; thus, the optimization of virus detection on the post-mortem formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is needed. Different techniques are available for the identification of the SARS-CoV-2, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy. The main goal of this study is to compare ISH versus RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 on post-mortem lung samples of positive deceased subjects. A total of 27 samples were analyzed by RT-PCR targeting different viral RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2, including envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genes and ISH targeting S and Orf1ab. All 27 cases showed the N gene amplification, 22 out of 27 the E gene amplification, 26 out of 27 the S gene amplification, and only 6 the ORF1ab gene amplification. The S ISH was positive only in 12 out of 26 cases positive by RT-PCR. The S ISH positive cases with strong and diffuse staining showed a correlation with low values of the number of the amplification cycles by S RT-PCR suggesting that ISH is a sensitive assay mainly in cases carrying high levels of S RNA. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that ISH assay has lower sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE compared to RT-PCR; however, it is able to localize the virus in the cellular context since it preserves the morphology.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00428-021-03262-8.\n\n[end paper 14]\n\n[begin paper 15]\n\nPMCID = 7536135\n\nTitle = The novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Possible environmental transmission, detection, persistence and fate during wastewater and water treatment\n\nThe contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19 disease, has infected over 27 million people across the globe within a few months. While literature on SARS-CoV-2 indicates that its transmission may occur predominantly via aerosolization of virus-laden droplets, the possibility of alternate routes of transmission and/or reinfection via the environment requires considerable scientific attention. This review aims to collate information on possible transmission routes of this virus, to ascertain its fate in the environment. Concomitant with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faeces and saliva of infected patients, studies also indicated its occurrence in raw wastewater, primary sludge and river water. Therefore sewerage system could be a possible route of virus outbreak, a possible tool to assess viral community spread and future surveillance technique. Hence, this review looked into detection, occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 during primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater and water treatment processes based on published literature on SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses. The review also highlights the need for focused research on occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 in various environmental matrices. Utilization of this information in environmental transmission models developed for other enveloped and enteric viruses can facilitate risk assessment studies. Preliminary research efforts with SARS-CoV-2 and established scientific reports on other coronaviruses indicate that the threat of virus transmission from the aquatic environment may be currently non-existent. However, the presence of viral RNA in wastewater provides an early warning that highlights the need for effective sewage treatment to prevent a future outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n[end paper 15]\n\n[begin paper 16]\n\nPMCID = 10829978\n\nTitle = PandoGen: Generating complete instances of future SARS-CoV-2 sequences using Deep Learning\n\nOne of the challenges in a viral pandemic is the emergence of novel variants with different phenotypical characteristics. An ability to forecast future viral individuals at the sequence level enables advance preparation by characterizing the sequences and closing vulnerabilities in current preventative and therapeutic methods. In this article, we explore, in the context of a viral pandemic, the problem of generating complete instances of undiscovered viral protein sequences, which have a high likelihood of being discovered in the future using protein language models. Current approaches to training these models fit model parameters to a known sequence set, which does not suit pandemic forecasting as future sequences differ from known sequences in some respects. To address this, we develop a novel method, called PandoGen, to train protein language models towards the pandemic protein forecasting task. PandoGen combines techniques such as synthetic data generation, conditional sequence generation, and reward-based learning, enabling the model to forecast future sequences, with a high propensity to spread. Applying our method to modeling the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence, we find empirically that our model forecasts twice as many novel sequences with five times the case counts compared to a model that is 30\u00d7 larger. Our method forecasts unseen lineages months in advance, whereas models 4\u00d7 and 30\u00d7 larger forecast almost no new lineages. When trained on data available up to a month before the onset of important Variants of Concern, our method consistently forecasts sequences belonging to those variants within tight sequence budgets.\n\nViral protein sequences play a pivotal role in the spread of a pandemic. As the virus evolves, so do the viral proteins, increasing the potency of the virus. Knowledge of future viral protein sequences can be invaluable because it allows us to test the efficacy of preventative and treatment methods against future changes to the virus, and tailor them to such changes early. We attempt to forecast viral proteins ahead of time. Making such predictions is very challenging and complex because the prediction target is a sequence with thousands of positions, and a single mis-predicted sequence position may invalidate the entire prediction. Also, as the virus continues to evolve, the data available to train models becomes obsolete. Addressing these challenges, we create a novel approach to train models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, that are especially tailored to forecasting future sequences. Models trained using this approach outperform existing approaches in their effectiveness. In addition, our method can train models to forecast important pandemic variants ahead of time.\n\n[end paper 16]\n\n[begin paper 17]\n\nPMCID = 8592829\n\nTitle = Comparative structural analyses of selected spike protein-RBD mutations in SARS-CoV-2 lineages\n\nThe severity of COVID-19 has been observed throughout the world as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally claimed more than 2 million lives and left a devastating impact worldwide. Recently several virulent mutant strains of this virus, such as the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 lineages, have emerged with initial predominance in UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Another extremely pathogenic B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages, first detected in India, are now affecting some countries at notably stronger spread-rates. The present paper computationally examines the time-based structures of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 lineages with selected spike protein mutations. The mutations in the more recently found B.1.617 lineage and its sub-lineages are explored, and the implications for multiple point mutations of the spike protein\u2019s receptor-binding domain (RBD) are described. The selected S1 mutations within the highly contagious B.1.617.2 sub-lineage, also known as the delta variant, are examined as well.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12026-021-09250-z.\n\n[end paper 17]\n\n[begin paper 18]\n\nPMCID = 11161772\n\nTitle = Biophysical principles predict fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThis research presents a biophysical model that maps the molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s receptor binding domain into an epistatic fitness landscape. By linking the binding affinities of the virus to its epidemic fitness, we offer a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the emergence and success of new viral variants. Our model, validated with real-world data and informed by theoretical insights, provides a foundation for interpreting the evolutionary trajectory of past pandemics and predicting those of the future. The adaptability of this biophysical model extends to the key proteins of other viruses as well, signifying its potential in guiding public health interventions, and advancing our understanding of viral evolution.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 employs its spike protein\u2019s receptor binding domain (RBD) to enter host cells. The RBD is constantly subjected to immune responses, while requiring efficient binding to host cell receptors for successful infection. However, our understanding of how RBD\u2019s biophysical properties contribute to SARS-CoV-2\u2019s epidemiological fitness remains largely incomplete. Through a comprehensive approach, comprising large-scale sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the identification of a fitness function based on binding thermodynamics, we unravel the relationship between the biophysical properties of RBD variants and their contribution to viral fitness. We developed a biophysical model that uses statistical mechanics to map the molecular phenotype space, characterized by dissociation constants of RBD to ACE2, LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10987, and S309, onto an epistatic fitness landscape. We validate our findings through experimentally measured and machine learning (ML) estimated binding affinities, coupled with infectivity data derived from population-level sequencing. Our analysis reveals that this model effectively predicts the fitness of novel RBD variants and can account for the epistatic interactions among mutations, including explaining the later reversal of Q493R. Our study sheds light on the impact of specific mutations on viral fitness and delivers a tool for predicting the future epidemiological trajectory of previously unseen or emerging low-frequency variants. These insights offer not only greater understanding of viral evolution but also potentially aid in guiding public health decisions in the battle against COVID-19 and future pandemics.\n\n[end paper 18]\n\n[begin paper 19]\n\nPMCID = 8505113\n\nTitle = Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry for site-specific glycoproteomics characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n\nThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19, is an abundant, heavily glycosylated surface protein that plays a key role in receptor binding and host cell fusion, and is the focus of all current vaccine development efforts. Variants of concern are now circulating worldwide that exhibit mutations in the spike protein. Protein sequence and glycosylation variations of the spike may affect viral fitness, antigenicity, and immune evasion. Global surveillance of the virus currently involves genome sequencing, but tracking emerging variants should include quantitative measurement of changes in site-specific glycosylation as well. In this work, we used data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to quantitatively characterize the five N-linked glycosylation sites of the glycoprotein standard alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as the 22 sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that DIA compared favorably to DDA in sensitivity, resulting in more assignments of low-abundance glycopeptides. However, the reproducibility across replicates of DIA-identified glycopeptides was lower than that of DDA, possibly due to the difficulty of reliably assigning low-abundance glycopeptides confidently. The differences in the data acquired between the two methods suggest that DIA outperforms DDA in terms of glycoprotein coverage but that overall performance is a balance of sensitivity, selectivity, and statistical confidence in glycoproteomics. We assert that these analytical and bioinformatics methods for assigning and quantifying glycoforms would benefit the process of tracking viral variants as well as for vaccine development.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03643-7.\n\n[end paper 19]\n\n[begin paper 20]\n\nPMCID = 8286882\n\nTitle = Rapid, label-free, and sensitive point-of-care testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG using all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor\n\nThe ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has promoted to develop novel serological testing technologies since they can be effectively complementary to RT-PCR. Here, a new all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor (FRMB) was constructed through combining all-fiber optical system, microfluidic chip, and multimode fiber bio-probe. The transmission of the incident light and the collection and transmission of Fresnel reflection light are achieved using a single-multi-mode fiber optic coupler (SMFC) without any other optical separation elements. This compact design greatly simplifies the whole system structure and improves light transmission efficiency, which makes\u00a0it suitable for the label-free, sensitive, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing (POCT) of targets in nanoliter samples. Based on Fresnel reflection mechanism and immunoassay principle, both the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be sensitively quantified in 7\u00a0min using the secondary antibodies-modified multimode fiber bio-probe. The FRMB performs in\u00a0one-step, is\u00a0accurate, label-free, and sensitive in situ/on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in serum with simple dilution\u00a0only. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG were 0.82\u00a0ng/mL and 0.45\u00a0ng/mL, respectively. Based on our proposed theory, the affinity constants of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibody and their respective secondary antibodies were also determined. The FRMB can be readily extended as a universal platform for the label-free, rapid, and sensitive in situ/on-site measurement of other biomarkers and the investigation of biomolecular interaction.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00604-021-04911-0.\n\n[end paper 20]\n\n[begin paper 21]\n\nPMCID = 8033097\n\nTitle = The percentages of SARS-CoV-2 protein similarity and identity with SARS-CoV and BatCoV RaTG13 proteins can be used as indicators of virus origin\n\nThere are three types of proteins in coronaviruses: nonstructural, structural, and accessory proteins. Coronavirus proteins are essential for viral replication and for the binding and invasion of hosts and the regulation of host cell metabolism and immunity. This study investigated the amino acid sequence similarity and identity percentages of 10 proteins in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and the Rhinolophus affinis bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13). The investigated proteins were the 1ab polyprotein, spike protein, orf3a, the envelope protein, the membrane protein, orf6, orf7a, orf7b, orf8, and the nucleocapsid protein. The online sequence alignment service of The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) was used to determine the percentages of protein similarity and identity in the three viruses. The results showed that the similarity and identity percentages of the SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 proteins were both greater than 95%, while the identity and similarity percentages of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were both greater than 38%. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 have high identity and similarity compared to those of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\n\nThe proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 are most identical and similar to those of BatCoV RaTG13 than to the proteins of SARS-CoV\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42485-021-00060-3.\n\n[end paper 21]\n\n[begin paper 22]\n\nPMCID = 7921825\n\nTitle = Electrochemical immunosensor with Cu2O nanocube coating for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic starting in 2020. Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25\u00a0fg\u00a0mL\u22121 to 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20\u00a0min with a low detection limit of 0.04\u00a0fg\u00a0mL\u22121 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97\u2013103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability. The nanobiodevice was also tested using real patients and healthy samples, where the results had been already obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, and showed satisfactory results.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00604-021-04762-9.\n\n[end paper 22]\n\n[begin paper 23]\n\nPMCID = 10124706\n\nTitle = A COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and immune-stimulating complexes\n\nSpike protein from SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic disease, constitutes a structural protein that proved to be the main responsible for neutralizing antibody production. Thus, its sequence is highly considered for the design of candidate vaccines. Animal cell culture represents the best option for the production of subunit vaccines based on recombinant proteins since they introduce post-translational modifications that are important to mimic the natural antigenic epitopes. Particularly, the human cell line HEK293T has been explored and used for the production of biotherapeutics since the products derived from them present human-like post-translational modifications that are important for the protein\u2019s activity and immunogenicity. The aim of this study was to produce and characterize a potential vaccine for COVID-19 based on the spike ectodomain (S-ED) of SARS-CoV-2 and two different adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide (AH) and immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs). The S-ED was produced in sHEK293T cells using a 1-L stirred tank bioreactor operated in perfusion mode and purified. S-ED characterization revealed the expected size and morphology. High N-glycan content was confirmed. S-ED-specific binding with the hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor was verified. The immunogenicity of S-ED was evaluated using AH and ISCOMs. Both formulations demonstrated the presence of anti-RBD antibodies in the plasma of immunized mice, being significantly higher for the latter adjuvant. Also, higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 were detected after the ex vivo immune stimulation of spleen-derived MNCs from ISCOMs immunized mice. Further analysis confirmed that S-ED/ISCOMs elicit neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n Trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-ED was produced in stable recombinant sHEK cells in serum-free medium. \n\n A novel S-ED vaccine formulation induced potent humoral and cellular immunity. \n\n S-ED formulated with ISCOMs adjuvant elicited a highly neutralizing antibody titer. \n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00253-023-12520-5.\n\n[end paper 23]\n\n[begin paper 24]\n\nPMCID = 10458003\n\nTitle = Dynamic Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Patient on Chemotherapy\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved significantly during the pandemic and resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 evolution during persistent cases could provide insight into the origins and dynamics of new variants. We report here a case of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia on chemotherapy with infection of SARS-CoV-2 for more than two months. Genomic surveillance of his serial SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens revealed two unprecedented large deletions, \u039415\u201326 and \u0394138\u2013145, in the viral spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) and demonstrated their dynamic shifts in generating these new variants. Located at antigenic supersites, these large deletions are anticipated to dramatically change the spike protein NTD in three-dimensional protein structure prediction, which may lead to immune escape but reduce their viral transmissibility. In summary, we present here a new viral evolutionary trajectory in a patient on chemotherapy.\n\n[end paper 24]\n\n[begin paper 25]\n\nPMCID = 8628143\n\nTitle = SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization in Convalescent Plasma and Commercial Lots of Plasma-Derived Immunoglobulin\n\nPatients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency (PID or SID) face increased insecurity and discomfort in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing if and to what extent their comorbidities may impact the course of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients in this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG).\n\nWhether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated (e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency) remains a pressing question for this patient population.\n\nWe investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until June 2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from May 2020 to August 2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present.\n\nFinal containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 single plasma donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations.\n\nCP donations presented with high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were not/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 600\u00a0IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities for SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021 entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 21\u00a0IU/mL in December 2020 to 506\u00a0IU/mL in June 2021 with a maximum of 864\u00a0IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published pharmacokinetic investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16\u00a0IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from May 2021 of 216\u00a0IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64\u00a0IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in June 2021.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until Fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products, implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40259-021-00511-9.\n\nPeople with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens such as bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins [Ig]) are prepared from plasma, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells, of healthy donors. This plasma is then split up during pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between December 2020 and June 2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864\u00a0IU/mL. Considering that the US represents Octapharma\u2019s main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG) neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially reach a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40259-021-00511-9.\n\n[end paper 25]\n\n[begin paper 26]\n\nPMCID = 7895511\n\nTitle = Screening and evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 components from Ephedra sinica by ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS approach\n\nTraditional Chinese medicines played an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 in 2020. Ephedra sinica, one of the major constituent herbs of multi-component herbal formula, has been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. However, its active components are still unclear. The objectives of this study are to screen and evaluate active components from the traditional Chinese medicine Ephedra sinica for the treatment of COVID-19. In our study, we established an ACE2/CMC bioaffinity chromatography model, and then developed an ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system for the active compounds screening and identification from Ephedra sinica extract. We performed molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays to assess the binding characteristics (binding mode and KD value). We used CCK-8 staining to assess the toxicity of screened compounds, and also used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to observe the viropexis effect of screened compounds in ACE2h cells. In this current work, one fraction was fished out, separated and identified as ephedrine (EP), pseudoephedrine (PEP), and methylephedrine (MEP). Binding assays showed that the three compounds could bind with ACE2 in a special way to some amino acid residues, similar to the way SARS-CoV-2 bound with ACE2. Additionally, the three compounds, especially EP, can inhibit the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus into ACE2h cells because they can reduce the entrance ratio of pseudovirus in the pseudovirus model. Overall, the ACE2/CMC-HPLC-IT-TOF-MS system was established and verified to be suitable for ACE2-targeted bioactive compound screening. EP, PEP, and MEP with ACE2-binding features were screened out from Ephedra sinica, and acted as blockers inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entering ACE2h cells.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03233-7.\n\n[end paper 26]\n\n[begin paper 27]\n\nPMCID = 8279807\n\nTitle = Phytocompounds of Rheum emodi, Thymus serpyllum, and Artemisia annua Inhibit Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Binding to ACE2 Receptor: In Silico Approach\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been declared as a global pandemic. Traditional medicinal plants have long history to treat viral infections. Our in silico approach suggested that unique phytocompounds such as emodin, thymol and carvacrol, and artemisinin could physically bind SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (6VXX and 6VYB), SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 South Africa variant of Spike glycoprotein (7NXA), and even with ACE2 and prevent the SARS-CoV-2 binding to the host ACE2, TMPRSS2 and neutrapilin-1 receptors. Since Chloroquine has been looked as potential therapy against COVID-19, we also compared the binding of chloroquine and artemisinin for its interaction with spike proteins (6VXX, 6VYB) and its variant 7NXA, respectively. Molecular docking study of phytocompounds and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed by using AutoDock/Vina software. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for 50ns. Among all the phytocompounds, molecular docking studies revealed lowest binding energy of artemisinin with 6VXX and 6VYB, with Etotal \u221210.5 KJ mol\u22121 and \u221210.3 KJ mol\u22121 respectively. Emodin showed the best binding affinity with 6VYB with Etotal \u22128.8 KJ mol\u22121and SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant (7NXA) with binding energy of \u22126.4KJ mol\u22121. Emodin showed best interactions with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with Etotal of \u22127.1 and \u22127.3 KJ mol\u22121 respectively, whereas artemisinin interacts with TMPRSS 2 and ACE2 with Etotal of \u22126.9 and \u22127.4 KJ mol\u22121 respectively. All the phytocompounds were non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. MD simulation showed that artemisinin has more stable interaction with 6VYB as compared to 6VXX, and hence proposed as potential phytochemical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE-2 receptor.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40495-021-00259-4.\n\n[end paper 27]\n\n[begin paper 28]\n\nPMCID = 8289455\n\nTitle = Ultrasensitive, high-throughput, and rapid simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and IgG/IgM antibodies within 10\u00a0min through an immunoassay biochip\n\nCOVID-19 is now a severe threat to global health.

The factors include microRNAs that have a wide regulatory potential and hence are particularly interesting. The review focuses on the potential roles of human microRNAs and the viral genome as well as microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical features of COVID-19.

Potential mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 may affect the clinical features of COVID-19 are discussed in brief.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its NSP6 and Orf9c proteins to interact with sigma receptors that are implicated in lipid remodeling and ER stress response, to infect cells. The drugs targeting the sigma receptors, sigma-1 and sigma-2, have emerged as effective candidates to reduce viral infectivity, and some of them are in clinical trials against COVID-19. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exerts remarkable antiviral activity, but, at the same time, the sigma-1 benzomorphan agonist, dextromethorphan, showed pro-viral activity. To explore the potential mechanisms of biased binding and activity of the two drugs, haloperidol and dextromethorphan towards NSP6, we herein utilized molecular docking\u2013based molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our extensive analysis of the protein-drug interactions, structural and conformational dynamics, residual frustrations, and molecular switches of NSP6-drug complexes indicates that dextromethorphan binding leads to structural destabilization and increase in conformational dynamics and energetic frustrations. On the other hand, the strong binding of haloperidol leads to minimal structural and dynamical perturbations to NSP6. Thus, the structural insights of stronger binding affinity and favorable molecular interactions of haloperidol towards viral NSP6 suggests that haloperidol can be potentially explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19.\n\n\u2022Inhibitors of sigma receptors are considered as potent drugs against COVID-19.\n\n\u2022Antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, binds strongly to NSP6 and induces the minimal changes in structure and dynamics of NSP6.\n\n\u2022Dextromethorphan, agonist of sigma receptors, binding leads to overall destabilization of NSP6.\n\n\u2022These two drugs bind with NSP6 differently and also induce differences in the structural and conformational changes that explain their different mechanisms of action.\n\n\u2022Haloperidol can be explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19.\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00109-020-01980-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n[end paper 30]\n\n[begin paper 31]\n\nPMCID = 10032659\n\nTitle = Pathogenic mechanisms of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)\n\nCOVID-19, with persistent and new onset of symptoms such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction that last for months and impact everyday functioning, is referred to as Long COVID under the general category of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). PASC is highly heterogenous and may be associated with multisystem tissue damage/dysfunction including acute encephalitis, cardiopulmonary syndromes, fibrosis, hepatobiliary damages, gastrointestinal dysregulation, myocardial infarction, neuromuscular syndromes, neuropsychiatric disorders, pulmonary damage, renal failure, stroke, and vascular endothelial dysregulation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PASC is essential to guide prevention and treatment. This review addresses potential mechanisms and hypotheses that connect SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term health consequences. Comparisons between PASC and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome will be addressed. Aligning symptoms with other chronic syndromes and identifying potentially regulated common underlining pathways may be necessary for understanding the true nature of PASC. The discussed contributors to PASC symptoms include sequelae from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or more organs, persistent reservoirs of the replicating virus or its remnants in several tissues, re-activation of latent pathogens such as Epstein\u2013Barr and herpes viruses in COVID-19 immune-dysregulated tissue environment, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation dysregulation, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins. The individualized nature of PASC symptoms suggests that different therapeutic approaches may be required to best manage specific patients.\n\n[end paper 31]\n\n[begin paper 32]\n\nPMCID = 10362000\n\nTitle = Identification and validation of fusidic acid and flufenamic acid as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication using DrugSolver CavitomiX\n\nIn this work, we present DrugSolver CavitomiX, a novel computational pipeline for drug repurposing and identifying ligands and inhibitors of target enzymes. The pipeline is based on cavity point clouds representing physico-chemical properties of the cavity induced solely by the protein. To test the pipeline\u2019s ability to identify inhibitors, we chose enzymes essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication as a test system. The active-site cavities of the viral enzymes main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (Plpro), as well as of the human transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), were selected as target cavities. Using active-site point-cloud comparisons, it was possible to identify two compounds\u2014flufenamic acid and fusidic acid\u2014which show strong inhibition of viral replication. The complexes from which fusidic acid and flufenamic acid were derived would not have been identified using classical sequence- and structure-based methods as they show very little structural (TM-score: 0.1 and 0.09, respectively) and very low sequence (~\u20095%) identity to Mpro and TMPRSS2, respectively. Furthermore, a cavity-based off-target screening was performed using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as an example. Using cavity comparisons, the human carboxylesterase was successfully identified, which is a described off-target for AChE inhibitors.\n\n[end paper 32]\n\n[begin paper 33]\n\nPMCID = 7856849\n\nTitle = Sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in a high-prevalence setting\n\nEvaluation and power of seroprevalence studies depend on the performed serological assays. The aim of this study was to assess four commercial serological tests from EUROIMMUN, DiaSorin, Abbott, and Roche as well as an in-house immunofluorescence and neutralization test for their capability to identify SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals in a high-prevalence setting. Therefore, 42 social and working contacts of a German super-spreader were tested. Consistent with a high-prevalence setting, 26 of 42 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive by neutralization test (NT), and immunofluorescence test (IFT) confirmed 23 of these 26 positive test results (NT 61.9% and IFT 54.8% seroprevalence). Four commercial assays detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 33.3-40.5% individuals. Besides an overall discrepancy between the NT and the commercial assays regarding their sensitivity, this study revealed that commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike-based assays are better to predict the neutralization titer than nucleoprotein-based assays are.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10096-021-04169-7.\n\n[end paper 33]\n\n[begin paper 34]\n\nPMCID = 10052277\n\nTitle = Detection of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain using fluorescence probe and DNA flowers enabled by rolling circle amplification\n\nUsing rolling circle amplification (RCA) and two different ways of signal readout, we developed analytical methods to detect the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein). We modified streptavidin-coated magnetic beads with an aptamer of RBD through a biotin-tagged complementary DNA strand (biotin-cDNA). Binding of RBD caused the aptamer to dissociate from the biotin-cDNA, making the cDNA available to initiate RCA on the magnetic beads. Detection of RBD was achieved using a dual signal output. For fluorescence signaling, the RCA products were mixed with a dsDNA probe labeled with fluorophore and quencher. Hybridization of the RCA products caused the dsDNA to separate and\u00a0to emit fluorescence (\u03bbex\u2009=\u2009488\u00a0nm, \u03bbem\u2009=\u2009520\u00a0nm). To generate easily detectable UV\u2013vis absorbance signal, the RCA amplification was extended to produce DNA flower to encapsulate horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The HRP-encapsulated DNA flower catalyzed a colorimetric reaction between H2O2 and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to generate an optical signal (\u03bbabs\u2009=\u2009450\u00a0nm). The fluorescence and colorimetric assays for RBD have low detection limits (0.11\u00a0pg\u00a0mL\u22121 and 0.904\u00a0pg\u00a0mL\u22121) and a wide linear range (0.001\u2013100\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121). For detection of RBD in human saliva, the recovery was 93.0\u2013100% for the fluorescence assay and 87.2\u2013107% for the colorimetric assay. By combining fluorescence and colorimetric detection with RCA, detection of the target RBD in human saliva was achieved with high sensitivity and selectivity.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00604-023-05747-6.\n\n[end paper 34]\n\n[begin paper 35]\n\nPMCID = 8883239\n\nTitle = In silico studies on structural inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro by major secondary metabolites of Andrographis paniculata and Cinchona officinalis\n\nThe COVID-19 infection by Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the largest pandemic diseases, with cumulative confirmed infections of 275,233,892 and 5,364,996 deaths to date according to World Health Organization. Due to the absence of any approved antiviral drug to treat COVID-19, its lethality is getting severe with time. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, Mpro is considered one of the potential drug targets because of its role in processing proteins translated from viral RNA. In the present study, four of the plant metabolites, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, andrograpanin, quinine, cinchonine from two eminent medicinal plants Andrographis paniculata and Cinchona officinalis, have been evaluated against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 through in-silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation study. From the result interpretations, it is found that andrograpanin has strong binding affinities with the target protein in its active site with potential negative energies. Molecular Dynamic simulation and MMGBSA studies suggest that earlier reported N3 inhibitor and andrograpanin exhibit effective binding interactions involving identical amino acid residues with the same binding pockets of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the theoretical experiment suggests that andrograpanin, could be considered the promising inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11756-022-01012-y.\n\n[end paper 35]\n\n[begin paper 36]\n\nPMCID = 8383918\n\nTitle = A rapid and reliable liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method for SARS-CoV-2 analysis from gargle solutions and saliva\n\nWe describe a rapid liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the direct detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in gargle solutions and saliva.

This underscores the need for efficient computational approaches. Recent advancements, like topological deep learning (TDL), have introduced powerful tools for forecasting emerging dominant variants, yet they require deep mutational scanning (DMS) of viral surface proteins and associated three-dimensional (3D) protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex structures. We propose an AlphaFold 3 (AF3)-assisted multi-task topological Laplacian (MT-TopLap) strategy to address this need. MT-TopLap combines deep learning with topological data analysis (TDA) models, such as persistent Laplacians (PL) to extract detailed topological and geometric characteristics of PPIs, thereby enhancing the prediction of DMS and binding free energy (BFE) changes upon virus mutations. Validation with four experimental DMS datasets of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) complexes indicates that our AF3 assisted MT-TopLap strategy maintains robust performance, with only an average 1.1% decrease in Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and an average 9.3% increase in root mean square errors (RMSE), compared with the use of experimental structures. Additionally, AF3-assisted MT-TopLap achieved a PCC of 0.81 when tested with a SARS-CoV-2 HK.3 variant DMS dataset, confirming its capability to accurately predict BFE changes and adapt to new experimental data, thereby showcasing its potential for rapid and effective response to fast viral evolution.\n\n[end paper 37]\n\n[begin paper 38]\n\nPMCID = 7603175\n\nTitle = In silico Investigation on the Inhibiting Role of Nicotine/Caffeine by Blocking the S Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Versus ACE2 Receptor\n\nIn this paper, we studied the in silico interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor with two bioactive compounds, i.e., nicotine and caffeine, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n[end paper 38]\n\n[begin paper 39]\n\nPMCID = 10261845\n\nTitle = Predicting the antigenic evolution of SARS-COV-2 with deep learning\n\nThe relentless evolution of SARS-CoV-2 poses a significant threat to public health, as it adapts to immune pressure from vaccines and natural infections. Gaining insights into potential antigenic changes is critical but challenging due to the vast sequence space. Here, we introduce the Machine Learning-guided Antigenic Evolution Prediction (MLAEP), which combines structure modeling, multi-task learning, and genetic algorithms to predict the viral fitness landscape and explore antigenic evolution via in silico directed evolution. By analyzing existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, MLAEP accurately infers variant order along antigenic evolutionary trajectories, correlating with corresponding sampling time. Our approach identified novel mutations in immunocompromised COVID-19 patients and emerging variants like XBB1.5. Additionally, MLAEP predictions were validated through in vitro neutralizing antibody binding assays, demonstrating that the predicted variants exhibited enhanced immune evasion.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recently identified as caused by a new type of coronaviruses. This type of coronavirus binds to the human receptor through the Spike glycoprotein (S) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). The spike protein is found in inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) conformations in which the accessible conformation causes severe infection. Thus, this receptor is a significant target for antiviral drug design.\n\nAn attempt was made to recognize 111 natural and synthesized compounds in order to utilize them against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to inhibit Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using simulation methods, such as molecular docking. The FAF-Drugs3, Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS), ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) databases along with Lipinski\u2019s rules were used to evaluate the drug-like properties of the identified ligands. In order to analyze and identify the residues critical in the docking process of the spike glycoprotein, the interactions of proposed ligands with both conformations of the spike glycoprotein was simulated.\n\nThe results showed that among the available ligands, seven ligands had significant interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein, in which angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is bounded. Out of seven candidate molecules, six ligands exhibited drug-like characteristics. The results also demonstrated that fluorophenyl and propane groups of ligands had optimal interactions with the binding site of the spike glycoprotein.\n\nAccording to the results, our findings indicated the ability of six ligands to prevent the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to its cognate receptor, providing novel compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42600-020-00122-3.\n\n[end paper 40]\n\n[begin paper 41]\n\nPMCID = 8216326\n\nTitle = Simultaneous enrichment and separation of neutral and sialyl glycopeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enabled by dual-functionalized Ti-IMAC material\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a serious threat to human health all over the world. The development of effective vaccines has been focusing on the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates viral invasion to human cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In this work, we perform analytical characterization of N- and O-linked glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. We explore the novel use of dual-functionalized titanium (IV)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ti-IMAC) material for simultaneous enrichment and separation of neutral and sialyl glycopeptides of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein from HEK293 cells. This strategy helps eliminate signal suppression from neutral glycopeptides for the detection of sialyl glycopeptides and improves the glycoform coverage of the S protein. We profiled 19 of its 22 potential N-glycosylated sites with 398 unique glycoforms using the dual-functional Ti-IMAC approach, which exhibited improvement of coverage by 1.6-fold compared to the conventional hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) glycopeptide enrichment method. We also identified O-linked glycosylation site that was not found using the conventional HILIC approach.

Although Remdesivir and the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone are currently on the market for treatment, Remdesivir lacks full efficacy and thus, more drugs are needed. This review was conducted through literature search of PubMed, MDPI, Google Scholar and Scopus. Upon review of existing literature, it is evident that marine organisms harbor numerous active metabolites with anti-viral properties that serve as potential leads for COVID-19 therapy. Inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) naturally found in marine bacteria and sponges have been shown to prevent viral entry, induce the innate immune response, and downregulate human ACE-2. Furthermore, several marine metabolites isolated from diverse sponges and algae have been shown to inhibit main protease (Mpro), a crucial protein required for the viral life cycle. Sulfated polysaccharides have also been shown to have potent anti-viral effects due to their anionic properties and high molecular weight. Likewise, select marine sponges produce bromotyrosines which have been shown to prevent viral entry, replication and protein synthesis. The numerous compounds isolated from marine resources demonstrate significant potential against COVID-19. The present review for the first time highlights marine bioactive compounds, their sources, and their anti-viral mechanisms of action, with a focus on potential COVID-19 treatment. \n\n[end paper 42]\n\n[begin paper 43]\n\nPMCID = 10811151\n\nTitle = Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in household domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) in Spain, 2019\u20132023\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans that emerged in late 2019. This virus is able to infect humans and different animal species. Among pets, cats and ferrets are more susceptible to be infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiological studies are an important tool to provide information under natural conditions of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. In comparison to cats, limited epidemiological studies have been performed in domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) reporting the presence of antibodies in this species. This study analysed the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 432 cliend-owned ferrets from different geographical areas of Spain during the different waves of COVID-19 outbreaks from December 2019 to May 2023 (42 months). For this purpose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent method (ELISA) using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen and confirmed by serum virus neutralization assay. Eighteen of the 432 ferrets included were seroreactive by the in-house ELISA (4.17%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.65\u20136.49). In this sense, the wave of COVID-19 with the higher number of seropositive ferrets occurred during the seventh wave when the different Omicron subvariants were the dominant virus variants. Our results suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in domestic ferrets in natural conditions is low. Further research is need to evaluate the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human to pets.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11259-023-10190-2.\n\n[end paper 43]\n\n[begin paper 44]\n\nPMCID = 8497067\n\nTitle = Simple workflow to repurpose SARS-CoV-2 swab/serum samples for the isolation of cost-effective antibody/antigens for proteotyping applications and diagnosis\n\nSupply shortage for the development and production of preventive, therapeutic, and diagnosis tools during the COVID-19 pandemic is an important issue affecting the wealthy and poor nations alike.

Inspired by various hemoperfusion and immune-affinity capture systems, a blood virus depletion device has been developed that offers highly efficient capture and removal of the targeted virus from the circulation, thus decreasing virus load. Single-domain antibodies against the Wuhan (VHH-72) virus strain produced by recombinant DNA technology were immobilized on the surface of glass micro-beads, which were then utilized as stationary phase. For feasibility testing, the virus suspension was flown through the prototype immune-affinity device that captured the viruses and the filtered media left the column. The feasibility test of the proposed technology was performed in a Biosafety Level 4 classified laboratory using the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain. The laboratory scale device actually captured 120,000 virus particles from the culture media circulation proving the feasibility of the suggested technology. This performance has an estimated capture ability of 15 million virus particles by using the therapeutic size column design, representing three times over-engineering with the assumption of 5 million genomic virus copies in an average viremic patient. Our results suggested that this new therapeutic virus capture device could significantly lower virus load thus preventing the development of more severe COVID-19 cases and consequently reducing mortality rate.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00604-023-05671-9.\n\n[end paper 45]\n\n[begin paper 46]\n\nPMCID = 8569510\n\nTitle = In-solution buffer-free digestion allows full-sequence coverage and complete characterization of post-translational modifications of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in a single ESI\u2013MS spectrum\n\nSubunit vaccines based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 provide one of the most promising strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The detailed characterization of the protein primary structure by mass spectrometry (MS) is mandatory, as described in ICHQ6B guidelines. In this work, several recombinant RBD proteins produced in five expression systems were characterized using a non-conventional protocol known as in-solution buffer-free digestion (BFD). In a single ESI\u2013MS spectrum, BFD allowed very high sequence coverage (\u2265\u200999%) and the detection of highly hydrophilic regions, including very short and hydrophilic peptides (2\u20138 amino acids), and the His6-tagged C-terminal peptide carrying several post-translational modifications at Cys538 such as cysteinylation, homocysteinylation, glutathionylation, truncated glutathionylation, and cyanylation, among others. The analysis using the conventional digestion protocol allowed lower sequence coverage (80\u201390%) and did not detect peptides carrying most of the above-mentioned PTMs. The two C-terminal peptides of a dimer [RBD(319\u2013541)-(His)6]2 linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys538-Cys538) with twelve histidine residues were only detected by BFD. This protocol allows the detection of the four disulfide bonds present in the native RBD, low-abundance scrambling variants, free cysteine residues, O-glycoforms, and incomplete processing of the N-terminal end, if present. Artifacts generated by the in-solution BFD protocol were also characterized. BFD can be easily implemented; it has been applied to the characterization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two RBD-based vaccines, and we foresee that it can be also helpful to the characterization of mutated RBDs.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03721-w.\n\n[end paper 46]\n\n[begin paper 47]\n\nPMCID = 8720170\n\nTitle = The Effects of ATIR Blocker on the Severity of COVID-19 in Hypertensive Inpatients and Virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hypertensive hACE2 Transgenic Mice\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for the cellular entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ACE2, via the Ang-(1-7)-Mas-R axis, is part of the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of the renin-angiotensin system. We studied hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension and hypertensive human(h) ACE2 transgenic mice to determine the outcome of COVID-19 with or without AT1 receptor (AT1R) blocker treatment. The severity of the illness and the levels of serum cardiac biomarkers (CK, CK-BM, cTnI), as well as the inflammation markers (IL-1, IL-6, CRP), were lesser in hypertensive COVID-19 patients treated with AT1R blockers than those treated with other antihypertensive drugs. Hypertensive hACE2 transgenic mice, pretreated with AT1R blocker, had increased ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney and heart, 1 day post-infection. We conclude that those hypertensive patients treated with AT1R blocker may be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, AT1R blockers had no effect on the severity of the illness but instead may have protected COVID-19 patients from heart injury, via the ACE2-angiotensin1-7-Mas receptor axis.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12265-021-10147-3.\n\n[end paper 47]\n\n[begin paper 48]\n\nPMCID = 9940079\n\nTitle = Immunoinformatics Study of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein Identifies Promising Epitopes with Mutational Implications\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving and new mutations are being reported from different parts of the world.

We mapped these mutations with seven N-protein epitopes to identify the loss of antigenicity in two of them, suggesting that the mutations occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 genome contribute to the alteration in the properties of epitopes.

Subsequently, the gold chip for SPR measurements was modified with Nb2C-SH QDs via covalent binding of the Au-S bond also by self-assembling interaction. Nb2C-SH QDs not only resulted in high bioaffinity toward aptamer but also enhanced the SPR response.

However, existing computational methods for protein mutation effects prediction are generally limited to single point mutations with global dependencies, and do not systematically take into account the local and global synergistic epistasis inherent in multiple point mutations.\n\nTo this end, we propose a novel spatial and sequential message passing neural network, named DDAffinity, to predict the changes in binding affinity caused by multiple point mutations based on protein 3D structures. Specifically, instead of being on the whole protein, we perform message passing on the k-nearest neighbor residue graphs to extract pocket features of the protein 3D structures. Furthermore, to learn global topological features, a two-step additive Gaussian noising strategy during training is applied to blur out local details of protein geometry. We evaluate DDAffinity on benchmark datasets and external validation datasets. Overall, the predictive performance of DDAffinity is significantly improved compared with state-of-the-art baselines on multiple point mutations, including end-to-end and pre-training based methods. The ablation studies indicate the reasonable design of all components of DDAffinity. In addition, applications in nonredundant blind testing, predicting mutation effects of SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants, and optimizing human antibody against SARS-CoV-2 illustrate the effectiveness of DDAffinity.\n\nDDAffinity is available at https://github.com/ak422/DDAffinity.\n\n[end paper 50]\n\n[begin paper 51]\n\nPMCID = 8036011\n\nTitle = Accuracy of the serological detection of IgG and IgM to SARS-Cov-2: a prospective, cross-sectional study\n\nIn response to the rapidly evolving of SARS-CoV-2 infection, numerous serological tests have been developed but their sensitivity and specificity are unclear. We collected serum samples of patients and health-care professionals to assess the accuracy of chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIA) to determine IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. We calculated the \u03c6 correlation for qualitative results and test accuracy, adopting the following case definition: either real-time-PCR positivity or serological positivity with at least two different tests. We analyzed 259 samples, obtaining strong correlation between CLIA and both LFIA for IgG (\u03c6=0.9), and moderate correlation for IgM (\u03c6=0.6). For patients, the sensitivity was suboptimal for all methods (CLIA 81%, LFIA A 85%, LFIA B 78%), while it was poor in asymptomatic health-care workers (CLIA 50%, LFIA A 50%, LFIA B 33%). Overall, CLIA is more sensitive and specific for the determination of both IgG and IgM, whilst both LFIA methods reported good sensitivity and specificity for IgG, but scarce sensitivity for the IgM determination. The determination of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG is useful to detect infection 6 days from symptom onset.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10096-021-04224-3.\n\n[end paper 51]\n\n[begin paper 52]\n\nPMCID = 8166382\n\nTitle = Simultaneous detection of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2 based on ultrasensitive single molecule assays\n\nNucleic acid detection technology based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody detection based on immunochromatography still have many problems such as false negatives for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, it is of great importance to develop new techniques to improve the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. We herein developed an ultrasensitive, rapid, and duplex digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dELISA) for simultaneous detection of spike (S-RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single molecule array. This assay effectively combines magnetic bead encoding technology and the ultrasensitive detection capability of a single molecule array. The detection strategies of S-RBD protein and N-protein exhibited wide response ranges of 0.34\u20131065\u00a0pg/mL and 0.183\u2013338\u00a0pg/mL with detection limits of 20.6\u00a0fg/mL and 69.8\u00a0fg/mL, respectively. It is a highly specific method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein and has minimal interference from other blood proteins. Moreover, the spike assay showed a satisfactory and reproducible recovery rate for the detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein in serum samples. Overall, this work provides a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein, which shows ultrasensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio and contributes to improve the diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03435-z.\n\n[end paper 52]\n\n[begin paper 53]\n\nPMCID = 8428493\n\nTitle = Development and application of a\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric biosensor based on the peroxidase-mimic activity of \u03b3-Fe2O3 nanoparticles\n\nA practical colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Characterized by a myriad of symptoms across different organ systems, LC presents significant diagnostic and management challenges. Central to the disorder is the role of low-grade inflammation, a non-classical inflammatory response that contributes to the chronicity and diversity of symptoms observed. This review explores the pathophysiological underpinnings of LC, emphasizing the importance of low-grade inflammation as a core component. By delineating the pathogenetic relationships and clinical manifestations of LC, this article highlights the necessity for an integrated approach that employs both personalized medicine and standardized protocols aimed at mitigating long-term consequences.

Most efforts aimed at inhibiting MPro activity have been channeled into competitive inhibition at the active site, but this strategy will require a high inhibitor concentration and impressive inhibitor-MPro binding affinity. Allosteric inhibition can potentially serve as an effective strategy for alleviating these limitations. In this study, the ability of antiviral natural products to inhibit MPro in an allosteric fashion was explored with in silico techniques. Molecular docking revealed a strong interaction between casticin, an antiviral flavonoid, and Mpro at a site distant from the active site. This site, characterized as a distal site, has been shown to have an interdependent dynamic effect with the active site region. Mpro only, Mpro-peptide (binary) and Mpro-peptide-casticin (ternary) complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations for 50\u00a0ns to investigate the modulatory activity of casticin binding on Mpro. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that binding of casticin at the distal site interferes with the proper orientation of the peptide substrate in the oxyanion hole of the active site, and this could lead to a halt or decrease in catalytic activity. This study therefore highlights casticin as a potential allosteric modulator of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, which could be optimized and developed into a potential lead compound for anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemotherapy.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42250-022-00411-7.\n\n[end paper 55]\n\n[begin paper 56]\n\nPMCID = 8359636\n\nTitle = Deciphering epigenetic(s) role in modulating susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection and/or outcome: a systematic rapid review\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic waves hitting worldwide result in drastic postinfection complications with interindividual variations, which raised the question for the cause of these observed variations.

AbMAP focuses on the hypervariable regions, employing contrastive augmentation and multitask learning to capture both structural and functional properties. This approach significantly improves prediction accuracy for various antibody properties, including antigen binding and paratope identification. AbMAP demonstrates high efficiency in antibody optimization, achieving an 82% hit rate in refining SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies. Importantly, it unlocks large-scale analysis of immune repertoires, revealing surprising structural and functional convergence across individuals despite sequence diversity.\n\nProtein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive success in modeling proteins. However, general-purpose \u201cfoundational\u201d PLMs have limited performance in modeling antibodies due to the latter\u2019s hypervariable regions, which do not conform to the evolutionary conservation principles that such models rely on. In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework called Antibody Mutagenesis-Augmented Processing (AbMAP), which fine-tunes foundational models for antibody-sequence inputs by supervising on antibody structure and binding specificity examples. Our learned feature representations accurately predict mutational effects on antigen binding, paratope identification, and other key antibody properties. We experimentally validate AbMAP for antibody optimization by applying it to refine a set of antibodies that bind to a SARS-CoV-2 peptide, and obtain an 82% hit-rate and up to 22-fold increase in binding affinity. AbMAP also unlocks large-scale analyses of immune repertoires, revealing that B-cell receptor repertoires of individuals, while remarkably different in sequence, converge toward similar structural and functional coverage. Importantly, AbMAP\u2019s transfer learning approach can be readily adapted to advances in foundational PLMs. We anticipate AbMAP will accelerate the efficient design and modeling of antibodies, expedite the discovery of antibody-based therapeutics, and deepen our understanding of humoral immunity.\n\n[end paper 57]\n\n[begin paper 58]\n\nPMCID = 9244507\n\nTitle = Recent advances in antiviral effects of probiotics: potential mechanism study in prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), progressively extended worldwide countries on an epidemic scale. Along with all the drug treatments suggested to date, currently, there are no approved management protocols and treatment regimens for SARS-CoV-2. The unavailability of optimal medication and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 indicates the requirement for alternative therapies. Probiotics are living organisms that deliberate beneficial effects on the host when used sufficiently and in adequate amounts, and fermented food is their rich source. Probiotics affect viruses by antiviral mechanisms and reduce diarrhea and respiratory tract infection. At this point, we comprehensively evaluated the antiviral effects of probiotics and their mechanism with a particular focus on SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we suggested the conceptual and potential mechanisms of probiotics by which they could exhibit antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2, according to the previous evidence concerning the mechanism of antiviral effects of probiotics. This study reviewed recent studies that speculate about the role of probiotics in the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm through the mechanisms such as induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6), inhibition of JAK signaling pathway, and act as HDAC inhibitor.

We performed language-model-guided affinity maturation of seven antibodies, screening 20 or fewer variants of each antibody across only two rounds of laboratory evolution, and improved the binding affinities of four clinically relevant, highly mature antibodies up to sevenfold and three unmatured antibodies up to 160-fold, with many designs also demonstrating favorable thermostability and viral neutralization activity against Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudoviruses.

The RBD is constantly subjected to immune responses, while requiring efficient binding to host cell receptors for successful infection. However, our understanding of how RBD\u2019s biophysical properties contribute to SARS-CoV-2\u2019s epidemiological fitness remains largely incomplete. Through a comprehensive approach, comprising large-scale sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the discovery of a fitness function based on binding thermodynamics, we unravel the relationship between the biophysical properties of RBD variants and their contribution to viral fitness. We developed a biophysical model that uses statistical mechanics to map the molecular phenotype space, characterized by binding constants of RBD to ACE2, LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10987, and S309, onto a epistatic fitness landscape. We validate our findings through experimentally measured and machine learning (ML) estimated binding affinities, coupled with infectivity data derived from population-level sequencing. Our analysis reveals that this model effectively predicts the fitness of novel RBD variants and can account for the epistatic interactions among mutations, including explaining the later reversal of Q493R. Our study sheds light on the impact of specific mutations on viral fitness and delivers a tool for predicting the future epidemiological trajectory of previously unseen or emerging low frequency variants.

Reports indicate that 30\u201360% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from neurological symptoms. To understand the molecular basis of the neurologic comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, we have investigated the genetic association between COVID-19 and various brain disorders through a systems biology-based network approach and observed a remarkable resemblance. Our results showed 123 brain-related disorders associated with COVID-19 and form a high-density disease-disease network. The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on human health.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this infectious disease a pandemic. At present, several clinical trials are going on to identify possible drugs for treating this infection. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is one of the most critical drug targets for the blockage of viral replication. The aim of this study was to identify potential natural anthraquinones that could bind to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and stop the viral replication. Blind molecular docking studies of 13 anthraquinones and one control drug (Boceprevir) with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were carried out using the SwissDOCK server, and alterporriol-Q that showed the highest binding affinity towards Mpro were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies. This study indicated that several antiviral anthraquinones could prove to be effective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro of COVID-19 as they bind near the active site having the catalytic dyad, HIS41 and CYS145 through non-covalent forces. The anthraquinones showed less inhibitory potential as compared to the FDA-approved drug, boceprevir. Among the anthraquinones studied, alterporriol-Q was found to be the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Further, MD simulation studies for Mpro- alterporriol-Q system suggested that alterporriol-Q does not alter the structure of Mpro to a significant extent. Considering the impact of COVID-19, identification of alternate compounds like alterporriol-Q that could inhibit the viral infection will help in accelerating the process of drug discovery.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11756-021-01004-4.\n\n[end paper 63]\n\n[begin paper 64]\n\nPMCID = 9760608\n\nTitle = Impact of BNT162b2 mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on interferon-alpha production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and autoreactive T cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: The COVALUS project\n\nTo evaluate the specific response of SLE patients to BNT162b2 vaccination and its impact on autoimmunity defined as in vivo production of interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and autoreactive immune responses.\n\nOur prospective study included SLE patients and healthy volunteers (HV) who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine 4 weeks apart.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that captures antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (and hence cannot discriminate between infection- and vaccine-induced seropositivity). Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for regional distribution, age, and sex.\n\nSamples from 7924 eligible donors were analyzed, including 620 (7.8%) vaccinated donors and 7046 (88.9%) unvaccinated donors (vaccination status unknown for 258 (3.3%) donors). Overall, median age was 51 years; 46.4% of donors were female.

We analysed clinical outcomes and antibody titres according to the presence of hyperglycaemia, i.e., either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, at the time of, or during, hospitalisation.\n\nAmong patients with confirmed COVID-19, 139 (27.3%) had diabetes: 90 (17.7%) had diabetes diagnosed prior to the hospital admission (comorbid diabetes) while 49 (9.6%) had diabetes diagnosed at the time of admission (newly diagnosed). Diabetes was associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers and hypercoagulopathy, as well as leucocytosis and neutrophilia. Diabetes was independently associated with risk of death (HR 2.32 [95% CI 1.44, 3.75], p\u2009=\u20090.001), even after adjustment for age, sex and other relevant comorbidities. Moreover, a strong association between higher glucose levels and risk of death was documented irrespective of diabetes diagnosis (HR 1.14\u2009\u00d7\u20091.1\u00a0mmol/l [95% CI 1.08, 1.21], p\u2009<\u20090.001). The humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with diabetes was present and superimposable, as for timing and antibody titres, to that of non-diabetic patients, with marginal differences, and was not influenced by glucose levels. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was predictive of survival rate, both in the presence or absence of diabetes.\n\nThe observed increased severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with hyperglycaemia was not the result of an impaired humoral response against SARS-CoV-2.

The papain-like protease (PLpro), nucleocapsid (N), main protease (Mpro) and non-structural protein (nsp12) of SARS-CoV-2, key component of processing of viral polyproteins, transcription, assembly and replication. On this streak, present study evaluated the interaction of ligand 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) with viral proteins using molecular docking with (i) AutoDock 4.2.6 and (ii) AutoDock Vina followed by molecular dynamic simulation studies of protein-ligand complex configuration. The analysis revealed that PLpro (3E9S) and N (4J3K) protein corresponds to the highest docking score and therefore, selected for molecular dynamics simulation study (100\u00a0ns). The study comprised analysis of parameters: (i) RMSD and RMSF, (ii) radius of gyration- which indicated interaction of protein entities with ligand supported steadiness of the complex, (iii) Coulombic and Lennard\u2013Jones interactions, which played a significant role in complex stability. DAPG showed a good number of H-bonds with PLpro and MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to the N protein. This study showed DAPG as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the PLpro thereby, DAPG can be used as potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and is potential drug candidate against COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11756-021-00979-4.\n\n[end paper 67]\n\n[begin paper 68]\n\nPMCID = 8175097\n\nTitle = Performance of a SARS CoV-2 antibody ELISA based on simultaneous measurement of antibodies against the viral nucleoprotein and receptor-binding domain\n\nSARS CoV-2 antibody assays measure antibodies against the viral nucleoprotein (NP) or spike protein. The study examined if testing of antibodies against both antigens increases the diagnostic sensitivity. Sera (N=98) from infected individuals were tested with ELISAs based on the NP, receptor-binding domain (RBD), or both proteins. The AUROCs were 0.958 (NP), 0.991 (RBD), and 0.992 (NP/RBD). The RBD- and NP/RBD-based ELISAs showed better performance than the NP-based assay. Simultaneous testing for antibodies against NP and RBD increased the number of true and false positives. If maximum diagnostic sensitivity is required, the NP/RBD-based ELISA is preferable. Otherwise, the RBD-based ELISA is sufficient.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10096-021-04284-5.\n\n[end paper 68]\n\n[begin paper 69]\n\nPMCID = 7998085\n\nTitle = Essentials in saline pharmacology for nasal or respiratory hygiene in times of COVID-19\n\nNasal irrigation or nebulizing aerosol of isotonic or hypertonic saline is a traditional method for respiratory or nasal care. A recent small study in outpatients with COVID-19 without acute respiratory distress syndrome suggests substantial symptom resolution. We therefore analyzed pharmacological/pharmacodynamic effects of isotonic or hypertonic saline, relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory care.\n\nMixed search method.\n\nDue to its wetting properties, saline achieves an improved spreading of alveolar lining fluid and has been shown to reduce bio-aerosols and viral load. Saline provides moisture to respiratory epithelia and gels mucus, promotes ciliary beating, and improves mucociliary clearance. Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 damage ciliated epithelium in the nose and airways. Saline inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells; possible interactions involve the viral ACE2-entry mechanism (chloride-dependent ACE2 configuration), furin and 3CLpro (inhibition by NaCl), and the sodium channel ENaC. Saline shifts myeloperoxidase activity in epithelial or phagocytic cells to produce hypochlorous acid. Clinically, nasal or respiratory airway care with saline reduces symptoms of seasonal coronaviruses and other common cold viruses. Its use as aerosol reduces hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in children. Preliminary data suggest symptom reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 patients if saline is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset.\n\nSaline interacts at various levels relevant to nasal or respiratory hygiene (nasal irrigation, gargling or aerosol). If used from the onset of common cold symptoms, it may represent a useful add-on to first-line interventions for COVID-19. Formal evaluation in mild COVID-19 is desirable as to establish efficacy and optimal treatment regimens.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00228-021-03102-3.\n\n[end paper 69]\n\n[begin paper 70]\n\nPMCID = 8716573\n\nTitle = Embeddings from protein language models predict conservation and variant effects\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants stressed the demand for tools allowing to interpret the effect of single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function. While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Matthews Correlation Coefficient\u2014MCC\u2014for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006 vs. 0.608\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competitive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome (~\u200920\u00a0k proteins) within 40\u00a0min on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000.

However, experimental screening for highly efficacious targeting antibodies is labor-intensive and of high cost, which is exacerbated by evolving antigen targets under selective pressure such as fast-mutating viral variants. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a machine learning-assisted antibody generation pipeline AbGen that greatly accelerates the screening and re-design of immunoglobulins G (IgGs) against a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus variant strains. Our AbGen centers around a novel antibody language model (AbLM) that is pretrained on 12 million generic protein domain sequences and fine-tuned on 4,000+ paired VH-VL sequences, with IgG-specific CDR-masking and VH-VL cross-attention. AbLM provides a latent space of IgG sequence embeddings for AbGen, including (a) landscapes of IgGs\u2019 activities in neutralizing the wild-type virus are analyzed through structure prediction for IgG and IgG-antigen (viral protein spike\u2019s receptor binding domain, RBD) interactions; and (b) landscapes of IgGs\u2019 susceptibility in neutralizing variant viruses are predicted through Gaussian process regression, despite that as few as 14 clinical antibodies\u2019 responses to variants of concern are available. The AbGen pipeline was applied to over 1300 IgG sequences we collected from RBD-binding B cells of convalescent patients. With experimental validations, AbGen efficiently prioritized IgG candidates against a broad spectrum of viral variants (wildtype, Delta, and Omicron), preventing the infection of host cells in vitro and hACE2 transgenic mice in vivo. Compared to other existing protein language models that require 10\u2013100 times more model parameters, AbLM improved the precision from around 50% to 75% to predict IgGs with low variant susceptibility. Furthermore, AbGen enables structure-based computational protein redesign for selected IgG clones with single amino acid substitutions at the RBD-binding interface that doubled the IgG blockade efficacy for one of the severe, therapy-resistant strains - Delta (B.1.617). Our work expedites applications of artificial intelligence in antibody screen and re-design combining data-driven protein language models and Kriging for antibody sequence analysis and activity prediction, in synergy with physics-driven protein docking and design for antibody-antigen interface analyses and functional optimization.\n\n[end paper 71]\n\n[begin paper 72]\n\nPMCID = 9038526\n\nTitle = Mild COVID-19 imprints a long-term inflammatory eicosanoid- and chemokine memory in monocyte-derived macrophages\n\nMonocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) drive the inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and they are a major source of eicosanoids in airway inflammation. Here we report that MDM from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild disease show an inflammatory transcriptional and metabolic imprint that lasts for at least 5 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. MDM from convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals showed a downregulation of pro-resolving factors and an increased production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, particularly 5-lipoxygenase-derived leukotrienes. Leukotriene synthesis was further enhanced by glucocorticoids and remained elevated at 3\u20135 months, but had returned to baseline at 12 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or LPS triggered exaggerated prostanoid-, type I IFN-, and chemokine responses in post COVID-19 MDM. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection leaves an inflammatory imprint in the monocyte/ macrophage compartment that drives aberrant macrophage effector functions and eicosanoid metabolism, resulting in long-term immune aberrations in patients recovering from mild COVID-19.\n\n[end paper 72]\n\n[begin paper 73]\n\nPMCID = 11794456\n\nTitle = DeepPFP: a multi-task-aware architecture for protein function prediction\n\nDeriving protein function from protein sequences poses a significant challenge due to the intricate relationship between sequence and function. Deep learning has made remarkable strides in predicting sequence-function relationships. However, models tailored for specific tasks or protein types encounter difficulties when using transfer learning across domains. This is attributed to the fact that protein function relies heavily on structural characteristics rather than mere sequence information. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a model capable of capturing shared features among diverse sequence-function mapping tasks to address the generalization issue. In this study, we explore the potential of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning combined with a protein language model called Evolutionary Scale Modeling to tackle this challenge. Our approach involves training the architecture on five out-domain deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets and evaluating its performance across four key dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed architecture exhibits satisfactory performance in terms of generalization and employs an effective few-shot learning strategy. To explain further, Compared to the best results, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) in the final stage increased by ~0.31%. Furthermore, we leverage the trained architecture to predict binding affinity scores of the DMS dataset of SARS-CoV-2 using transfer learning. Notably, training on a subset of the Ube4b dataset with 500 samples resulted in a notable improvement of 0.11 in the PCC. These results underscore the potential of our conceptual architecture as a promising methodology for multi-task protein function prediction.\n\n[end paper 73]\n\n[begin paper 74]\n\nPMCID = 7791912\n\nTitle = Combination and tricombination therapy to destabilize the structural integrity of COVID-19 by some bioactive compounds with antiviral drugs: insights from molecular docking study\n\nRecently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic virus has been spreading throughout the world. Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir, baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11224-020-01723-5.\n\n[end paper 74]\n\n[begin paper 75]\n\nPMCID = 9868522\n\nTitle = Prediction of antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs\n\nThe ability to predict antibody\u2013antigen binding is essential for computational models of antibody affinity maturation and protein design. While most models aim to predict binding for arbitrary antigens and antibodies, the global impact of SARS-CoV-2 on public health and the availability of associated data suggest that a SARS-CoV-2-specific model would be highly beneficial. In this work, we present a neural network model, trained on \u223c315\u00a0000 datapoints from deep mutational scanning experiments, that predicts escape fractions of SARS-CoV-2 RBDs binding to arbitrary antibodies. The antibody embeddings within the model constitute an effective sequence space, which correlates with the Hamming distance, suggesting that these embeddings may be useful for downstream tasks such as binding prediction. Indeed, the model achieves Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.46 and 0.52 on two held-out test sets. By comparison, correlation coefficients calculated using existing structure and sequence-based models do not exceed 0.28. The correlation coefficient against dissociation constants of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants is 0.46. Additionally, the residue-level escapes are highest in the antibody epitope, correlating well with experimentally measured escapes. We further study the effect of antibody chain use, embedding dimension size and feed-forward and convolutional architectures on the model results. Lastly, we find that the inference time of our model is significantly faster than previous models, suggesting that it could be a useful tool for the accurate and rapid prediction of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs.\n\nThe model and associated code are available for download at https://github.com/ericzwang/RBD_AB.\n\n Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.\n\n[end paper 75]\n\n[begin paper 76]\n\nPMCID = 7541100\n\nTitle = An Assessment on Impact of COVID-19 Infection in a Gender Specific Manner\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first time reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and thereafter quickly spread across the globe. Till September 19,\u00a02020, COVID-19 has spread to 216 countries and territories. Severe infection of SARS-CoV-2 cause extreme increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that may lead to multi-organ damage and respiratory failure. Currently, no specific treatment and authorized vaccines are available for its treatment. Renin angiotensin system holds a promising role in human physiological system specifically in regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Renin angiotensin system by utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for its cellular entry. This interaction hampers the protective action of ACE2 in the cells and causes injuries to organs due to persistent angiotensin II (Ang-II) level. Patients with certain comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are under the high risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Moreover, evidence obtained from several reports also suggests higher susceptibility of male patients for COVID-19 mortality and other acute viral infections compared to females. Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemiological data also indicate a gender-based preference in disease consequences. The current review addresses the possible mechanisms responsible for higher COVID-19 mortality among male patients. The major underlying aspects that was looked into includes smoking, genetic factors, and the impact of reproductive hormones on immune systems and inflammatory responses. Detailed investigations of this gender disparity could provide insight into the development of patient tailored therapeutic approach which would be helpful in improving the poor outcomes of COVID-19.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s12015-020-10048-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n[end paper 76]\n\n[begin paper 77]\n\nPMCID = 7476649\n\nTitle = Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Viral Infections: Implications for COVID-19\n\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) constitute a heterogeneous population of stromal cells with immunomodulatory and regenerative properties that support their therapeutic use. MSCs isolated from many tissue sources replicate vigorously in vitro and maintain their main biological properties allowing their widespread clinical application. To date, most MSC-based preclinical and clinical trials targeted immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, MSCs have antiviral properties and have been used in the treatment of various viral infections in the last years. Here, we revised in detail the biological properties of MSCs and their preclinical and clinical applications in viral diseases, including the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19). Notably, rapidly increasing numbers of MSC-based therapies for COVID-19 have recently been reported. MSCs are theoretically capable of reducing inflammation and promote lung regeneration in severe COVID-19 patients. We critically discuss the rationale, advantages and disadvantages of MSC-based therapies for viral infections and also specifically for COVID-19 and point out some directions in this field. Finally, we argue that MSC-based therapy may be a promising therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 and other emergent respiratory tract viral infections, beyond the viral infection diseases in which MSCs have already been clinically applied.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s12015-020-10032-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n[end paper 77]\n\n[begin paper 78]\n\nPMCID = 9909147\n\nTitle = Liposome-based high-throughput and point-of-care assays toward the quick, simple, and sensitive detection of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patient sera\n\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 caused an increased interest in neutralizing antibody tests to determine the immune status of the population. Standard live-virus-based neutralization assays such as plaque-reduction assays or pseudovirus neutralization tests cannot be adapted to the point-of-care (POC). Accordingly, tests quantifying competitive binding inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by neutralizing antibodies have been developed. Here, we present a new platform using sulforhodamine B encapsulating liposomes decorated with RBD as foundation for the development of both a fluorescent, highly feasible high-throughput (HTS) and a POC-ready neutralizing antibody assay. RBD-conjugated liposomes are incubated with serum and subsequently immobilized in an ACE2-coated plate or mixed with biotinylated ACE2 and used in test strip with streptavidin test line, respectively. Polyclonal neutralizing human antibodies were shown to cause complete binding inhibition, while S309 and CR3022 human monoclonal antibodies only caused partial inhibition, proving the functionality of the assay. Both formats, the HTS and POC assay, were then tested using 20 sera containing varying titers of neutralizing antibodies, and a control panel of sera including prepandemic sera and reconvalescent sera from respiratory infections other than SARS-CoV-2. Both assays correlated well with a standard pseudovirus neutralization test (r = 0.847 for HTS and r = 0.614 for POC format). Furthermore, excellent correlation (r = 0.868) between HTS and POC formats was observed. The flexibility afforded by liposomes as signaling agents using different dyes and sizes can hence be utilized in the future for a broad range of multianalyte neutralizing antibody diagnostics.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-023-04548-3.\n\n[end paper 78]\n\n[begin paper 79]\n\nPMCID = 8445501\n\nTitle = Detection and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus variants of concern with mass spectrometry\n\nMass mapping using high-resolution mass spectrometry has been applied to identify and rapidly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains across five major variants of concern. Deletions or mutations within the surface spike protein across these variants, which originated in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and India (known as the alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants respectively), lead to associated mass differences in the mass maps. Peptides of unique mass have thus been determined that can be used to identify and distinguish the variants. The same mass map profiles are also utilized to construct phylogenetic trees, without the need for protein (or gene) sequences or their alignment, in order to chart and study viral evolution. The combined strategy offers advantages over conventional PCR-based gene-based approaches exploiting the ease with which protein mass maps can be generated and the speed and sensitivity of mass spectrometric analysis.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03649-1.\n\n[end paper 79]\n\n[begin paper 80]\n\nPMCID = 8105700\n\nTitle = Analysis of natural compounds against the activity of SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 protein towards an effective treatment against COVID-19: a theoretical and computational biology approach\n\nCoronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV), continues to emerge as a serious threat to public health. This pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus-2) has infected globally with 1,550,000 plus deaths to date, representing a high risk to public health. No effective drug or vaccine is available to curb down this deadly virus. The expedition for searching for a potential drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is of massive potential and favour to the community. This study is focused on finding an effective natural compound that can be processed further into a potential inhibitor to check the activity of SARS-CoV-2 with minimal side effects targeting NSP15 protein, which belongs to the EndoU enzyme family. The natural screening suggested two efficient compounds (PubChem ID: 95372568 and 1776037) with dihydroxyphenyl region of the compound, found to be important in the interaction with the viral protein showing promising activity which may act as a potent lead inhibitory molecule against the virus.

While clinical trials have demonstrated promising outcomes using anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicines in immunocompetent hosts, their ability to achieve sustained viral clearance in immunodeficient patients remains unknown. We therefore aimed to study long-term virological outcomes in patients treated at our centre.\n\nWe followed up immunocompromised inpatients treated with casirivimab-imdevimab (Ronapreve) between September and December 2021, and immunocompromised patients who received sotrovimab, molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), or no treatment from December 2021 to March 2022. Nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples were obtained either in hospital or in the community until sustained viral clearance, defined as 3 consecutive negative PCR samples, was achieved. Positive samples were sequenced and analysed for mutations of interest.\n\nWe observed sustained viral clearance in 71 of 103 patients, none of whom died. Of the 32/103 patients where sustained clearance was not confirmed, 6 died (between 2 and 34 days from treatment). Notably, we observed 25 cases of sputum positivity despite negative nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity following a negative sample in 12 cases. Patients were then divided into those who cleared within 28 days and those with PCR positivity beyond 28 days. We noted lower B cell counts in the group with persistent PCR positivity (mean (SD) 0.06 (0.10) \u00d7109/L vs 0.22 (0.28) \u00d7109/L, p = 0.015) as well as lower IgA (median (IQR) 0.00 (0.00\u20130.15) g/L vs 0.40 (0.00\u20130.95) g/L, p = 0.001) and IgM (median (IQR) 0.05 (0.00\u20130.28) g/L vs 0.35 (0.10\u20131.10) g/L, p = 0.005).

However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed GICA for detection of total antibodies could be a powerful complement to the current RNA tests for COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10096-020-04102-4.\n\n[end paper 82]\n\n[begin paper 83]\n\nPMCID = 7657070\n\nTitle = Molecular basis for drug repurposing to study the interface of the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 through docking, characterization, and molecular dynamics for natural drug candidates\n\nA novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in Wuhan state of China in 2019 is the causative agent of deadly disease COVID-19. It has spread across the globe (more than 210 countries) within a short period. Coronaviruses pose serious health threats to both humans and animals.

Toxicity analysis was also performed for the best hits, and the final complex structures for four complexes were subjected to 400\u00a0ns molecular dynamics simulations for stability testing. We found two natural origin inhibitors for the S protein: human ACE2 complex (Andrographolide and Pterostilbene) which displayed better inhibition potential for ACE2 receptor and its binding with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative studies were also performed to test and verify that these two drug candidates are also better than hydroxychloroquine which is known to inhibit this complex. However, we needed better potential drug candidates to overcome the side effects of hydroxychloroquine.

Genetic polymorphisms in other multiple genes, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and interleukin-6, are also closely associated with underlying diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which substantially raise SARS-CoV-2 mortality. However, it is unknown how these genetic polymorphisms contribute to the disparate mortality rates, with or without underlying diseases. Of particular interest is the potential that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may be influencing the disparity of COVID-19 mortality rates in Black communities. Here, we review the evidence that biological predisposition for high-risk comorbid conditions may be relevant to our ability to fully understand and therefore address health disparities of COVID-19 deaths in Blacks.\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s40615-020-00871-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n[end paper 84]\n\n[begin paper 85]\n\nPMCID = 7914120\n\nTitle = Structure-activity relationship (SAR) and molecular dynamics study of withaferin-A fragment derivatives as potential therapeutic lead against main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2\n\nThe spread of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has directed to a state of an unprecedented global pandemic. Many synthetic compounds and FDA-approved drugs have been significantly inhibitory against the virus, but no SARS-CoV-2 solution has been identified. However, small molecule fragment\u2013based derivatives of potent phytocompounds may serve as promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. In the pursuit of exploring novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, we generated small molecule fragment derivatives from potent phytocompounds using neural networking and machine learning\u2013based tools, which can cover unexplored regions of the chemical space that still retain lead-like properties. Out of 300 derivative molecules from withaferin-A, hesperidin, and baicalin, 30 were screened out with synthetic accessibility scores >\u20094 having the best ADME properties. The withaferin-A derivative molecules 61 and 64 exhibited a significant binding affinity of \u2212\u20097.84\u00a0kcal/mol and \u2212\u20097.94\u00a0kcal/mol. The docking study reveals that withaferin-A mol 61 forms 5 polar H-bonds with the Mpro where amino acids involved are GLU166, THR190, CYS145, MET165, and GLN152 and upon QSAR analysis showed a minimal predicted IC50 value of 7762.47\u00a0nM. Furthermore, the in silico cytotoxicity predictions, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation studies have resulted in predicting the highly potent small molecule derivative from withaferin-A (phytocompound from Withania somnifera) to be the potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV 2 protease (Mpro) and a promising future lead candidate against COVID-19. The rationale of choosing withaferin-A from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) was propelled by the innumerous applications of Ashwagandha for the treatment of various antiviral diseases, common cold, and fever since time immemorial.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00894-021-04703-6.\n\n[end paper 85]\n\n[begin paper 86]\n\nPMCID = 7680993\n\nTitle = Probiotics-Derived Peptides and Their Immunomodulatory Molecules Can Play a Preventive Role Against Viral Diseases Including COVID-19\n\nAs of recent, the pandemic episode of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome brought about by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) expanding the pace of mortality, has affected the disease rate profoundly. Invulnerability is the fundamental choice to prevent the ruining event of COVID-19, as the drugs and antibodies are in the phase of preliminary clinical trials. Within this brief period, a few strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been recognized by the vaccine manufacturers, which could be an incorrect guess about the strain that will end up spreading. Since the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to mutate, immunizations, if at all works, might be for a restricted time. We have not put sufficient time in research to understand the immune responses that correlate with protection as this could help refine vaccines. Here, we have summed up the adequacy of the immunomodulatory component of probiotics for the prevention against viral infections. Furthermore, an in silico data have been provided in support of the \u201cprobiotics-derived lipopeptides\u201d role in inactivating spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor molecule, ACE2. Among well characterized lipopeptides derived from different probiotic strains, subtilisin (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), curvacin A (Lactobacillus curvatus), sakacin P (Lactobacillus sakei), lactococcin Gb (Lactococcus lactis) was utilized in this study to demonstrate a higher binding proclivity to S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2. The outcome revealed noteworthy capabilities of the lipopeptides, due to their amphiphilic nature, to bind spike protein and receptor molecule, which may act to competitively inhibit the mandatory interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host epithelial cell expressing ACE2 for its entry into the cell for reproduction. In the current situation, probiotic treatment alongside chemotherapy may assist in bringing about substantial improvement of the health of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, probiotics may aid towards building up the immune defenses in people to evade COVID-19.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12602-020-09727-7.\n\n[end paper 86]\n\n[begin paper 87]\n\nPMCID = 9066385\n\nTitle = Artificial Neural Network-Based Study Predicts GS-441524 as a Potential Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Activator Protein Furin: a Polypharmacology Approach\n\nFurin, a pro-protein convertase, plays a significant role as a biological scissor in bacterial, viral, and even mammalian substrates which in turn decides the fate of many viral and bacterial infections along with the numerous ailments caused by cancer, diabetes, inflammations, and neurological disorders. In the wake of the current pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, furin has become the center of attraction for researchers as the spike protein contains a polybasic furin cleavage site. In the present work, we have searched for novel inhibitors against this interesting human target from FDA-approved antiviral. To enhance the selection of new inhibitors, we employed Kohonen\u2019s artificial neural network-based self-organizing maps for ligand-based virtual screening. Promising results were obtained which can help in drug repurposing and network pharmacology studies can address the errors generated due to promiscuity/polypharmacology. We found 15 existing FDA antiviral drugs having the potential to inhibit furin. Among these, six compounds have targets on important human proteins (LDLR, FCGR1A, PCK1, TLR7, DNA, and PNP). The role of these 15 drugs inhibiting furin can be established by studying further on patients infected with number of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose two promising candidate FDA drugs GS-441524 and Grazoprevir (MK-5172) for repurposing as inhibitors of furin. The best results were observed with GS-441524.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12010-022-03928-2.\n\n[end paper 87]\n\n[begin paper 88]\n\nPMCID = 8390178\n\nTitle = The opportunity cost of automated glycopeptide analysis: case study profiling the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein\n\nGlycosylation analysis of viral glycoproteins contributes significantly to vaccine design and development. Among other benefits, glycosylation analysis allows vaccine developers to assess the impact of construct design or producer cell line choices for vaccine production, and it is a key measure by which glycoproteins that are produced for use in vaccination can be compared to their native viral forms. Because many viral glycoproteins are multiply glycosylated, glycopeptide analysis is a preferrable approach for mapping the glycans, yet the analysis of glycopeptide data can be cumbersome and requires the expertise of an experienced analyst. In recent years, a commercial software product, Byonic, has been implemented in several instances to facilitate glycopeptide analysis on viral glycoproteins and other glycoproteomics data sets, and the purpose of the study herein is to determine the strengths and limitations of using this software, particularly in cases relevant to vaccine development. The glycopeptides from a recombinantly expressed trimeric S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were first analyzed using an expert-based analysis strategy; subsequently, analysis of the same data set was completed using Byonic. Careful assessment of instances where the two methods produced different results revealed that the glycopeptide assignments from Byonic contained more false positives than true positives, even when the data were assessed using a 1% false discovery rate. The work herein provides a roadmap for removing the spurious assignments that Byonic generates, and it provides an assessment of the opportunity cost for relying on automated assignments for glycopeptide data sets from viral glycoproteins.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03621-z.\n\n[end paper 88]\n\n[begin paper 89]\n\nPMCID = 9898852\n\nTitle = SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological trend before vaccination era: a seroprevalence study in Apulia, Southern Italy, in 2020\n\nThe present study aimed at assessing the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the general population in the province of Bari (Apulia region, Southern Italy) during the year 2020.\n\nIn this study, 1325 serum samples collected from January to December 2020 were tested for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 antigen by commercial ELISA. Positive samples were further tested by in-house ELISA for the detection of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG antibodies and by micro-neutralization (MN) assay for the detection of neutralizing antibody.\n\nOne hundred (7.55%) samples had the presence of at least one antibody class against SARS-CoV-2 by commercial ELISA, of which 88 (6.6%) showed IgG and 19 (1.4%) showed IgM antibodies. The proportion of samples with IgG antibodies increased from 1.9% in January\u2013February to 9.6% in November\u2013December, while no significant increase was observed for IgM.

Several vaccines have been authorized by WHO, FDA, or MOH of different countries. However, issues such as need for cold chain, price, and most importantly access problems have limited vaccine usage in some nations especially developing countries. Moreover, the vast global demand justifies further attempts for vaccine development. Multi-epitope polypeptide vaccines enjoy several key features including safety and lower production and transfer costs and could be designed by in silico tools. Spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), the three major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, are ideal candidates for epitope selection. ORF3a (open reading frame3a), a transmembrane protein with pro-apoptotic functions, could be another proper target. Thus, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed using these four proteins and LL37, a TLR3 agonist adjuvant, through different immunoinformatics and bioinformatics tools. The proposed multi-epitope vaccine is expected to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with a population coverage of 76.92\u2009% due to containing different immunodominant epitopes and LL37 adjuvant. Selecting epitopes derived from one functional and three structural proteins suggests the protective ability of the vaccine irrespective of probable virus mutations. The computationally observed proper interaction of LL37 with TLR3 implies its ability to induce immune responses effectively. Besides, it showed acceptable structural and physicochemical properties. The in-silico cloning results predicted its high efficiency production in Escherichia coli. Future experimental studies could further confirm its immunological efficacy.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11756-021-00866-y.\n\n[end paper 90]\n\n[begin paper 91]\n\nPMCID = 7481766\n\nTitle = Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors and COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Evidence for Significant Geographical Disparities\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, it remains unclear whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) affects the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this meta-analysis, PubMed, CENTRAL, and grey literature were searched from their inception to 19 May 2020 for randomized, controlled trials or observational studies that evaluate the association between the use of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and the risk for major clinical endpoints (infection, hospitalization, admission to ICU, death) in adult patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a subgroup geographical analysis of outcomes was performed. Studies including less than 100 subjects were excluded from our analysis.\n\nIn total, 25 observational studies were included. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were not associated with increased odds for SARS-CoV-2 infection, admission to hospital, severe or critical illness, admission to ICU, and SARS-CoV-2-related death. In Asian countries, the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs decreased the odds for severe or critical illness and death (OR\u2009=\u20090.37, 95% CI 0.16\u20130.89, I2\u00a0=\u200983%, and OR\u2009=\u20090.62, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.99, I2\u00a0=\u20090%, respectively), whereas they increased the odds for ICU admission in North America and death in Europe (OR\u2009=\u20091.75, 95% CI 1.37\u20132.23, I2\u00a0=\u20090%, and OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.70, I2\u00a0=\u200982%, respectively).

The need to produce novel small-molecule inhibitors against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of drugs such as chloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone, favipiravir, ribavirin, remdesivir and azithromycin. Moreover, the reports of the clinical trials of these drugs proved to produce detrimental effects on patients with side effects like nephrotoxicity, retinopathy, cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy. Recognizing the need for effective and non-harmful therapeutic candidates to combat COVID-19, we aimed to develop promising drugs against SARS-COV-2.\n\nIn the current investigation, high-throughput virtual screening was performed using the Comprehensive Marine Natural Products Database against five non-structural proteins: Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp12, Nsp13 and Nsp15. Furthermore, standard precision (SP) docking, extra precision (XP) docking, binding free energy calculation and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity studies were performed using the Schr\u04e7dinger suite. The top-ranked 5 hits obtained by computational studies exhibited to possess a greater binding affinity with the selected non-structural proteins. Amongst the five hits, CMNPD5804, CMNPD20924 and CMNPD1598 hits were utilized to design a novel molecule (D) that has the capability of interacting with all the key residues in the pocket of the selected non-structural proteins. Furthermore, 200 ns of molecular dynamics simulation studies provided insight into the binding modes of D within the catalytic pocket of selected proteins.\n\nHence, it is concluded that compound D could be a promising inhibitor against these non-structural proteins. Nevertheless, there is still a need to conduct in vitro and in vivo studies to support our findings.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00894-023-05574-9.\n\n[end paper 92]\n\n[begin paper 93]\n\nPMCID = 8301390\n\nTitle = Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Factors in Human Alveolar Type II Cells in Aging and Emphysema\n\nAlveolar type II (ATII) cells proliferate and restore the injured epithelium. It has been described that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs. However, host factors facilitating virus infection in ATII cells are not well known. We determined the SARS-CoV-2-related genes and protein expression using RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, in ATII cells isolated from young and elderly non-smokers, smokers, and ex-smokers. Cells were also obtained from lung transplants of emphysema patients. ACE2 has been identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and we found significantly increased levels in young and elderly smokers and emphysema patients. The viral entry depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, and a higher expression was detected in elderly smokers and ex-smokers and emphysema patients. Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were higher in this disease in comparison with non-smokers. CD209L serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and we found increased levels in ATII cells obtained from smokers and in emphysema patients. Also, our data suggest CD209L regulation by miR142. Endoplasmic reticulum stress was detected in ATII cells in this disease. Our results suggest that upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in ATII cells in aging, smokers, and emphysema patients may facilitate infection.\n\n[end paper 93]\n\n[begin paper 94]\n\nPMCID = 11614202\n\nTitle = Prediction of virus-host associations using protein language models and multiple instance learning\n\nPredicting virus-host associations is essential to determine the specific host species that viruses interact with, and discover if new viruses infect humans and animals. Currently, the host of the majority of viruses is unknown, particularly in microbiomes. To address this challenge, we introduce EvoMIL, a deep learning method that predicts the host species for viruses from viral sequences only. It also identifies important viral proteins that significantly contribute to host prediction. The method combines a pre-trained large protein language model (ESM) and attention-based multiple instance learning to allow protein-orientated predictions. Our results show that protein embeddings capture stronger predictive signals than sequence composition features, including amino acids, physiochemical properties, and DNA k-mers. In multi-host prediction tasks, EvoMIL achieves median F1 score improvements of 10.8%, 16.2%, and 4.9% in prokaryotic hosts, and 1.7%, 6.6% and 11.5% in eukaryotic hosts. EvoMIL binary classifiers achieve impressive AUC over 0.95 for all prokaryotic hosts and range from roughly 0.8 to 0.9 for eukaryotic hosts. Furthermore, EvoMIL identifies important proteins in the prediction task, capturing key functions involved in virus-host specificity.\n\nBeing able to predict which viruses can infect which host species, and identifying the specific proteins that are involved in these interactions, are fundamental tasks in virology. Traditional methods for predicting these interactions rely on identifying common features among proteins, overlooking the structure of the protein \u201clanguage\u201d encoded in individual proteins. We have developed a novel method that combines a protein language model and multiple instance learning to allow host prediction directly from protein sequences, without the need to extract features manually. This method significantly improved prediction accuracy and revealed key proteins involved in virus-host interactions.\n\n[end paper 94]\n\n[begin paper 95]\n\nPMCID = 8248955\n\nTitle = Macrolactin A as a Novel Inhibitory Agent for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro: Bioinformatics Approach\n\nCOVID-19 is a disease that puts most of the world on lockdown and the search for therapeutic drugs is still ongoing. Therefore, this study used in silico screening to identify natural bioactive compounds from fruits, herbaceous plants, and marine invertebrates that are able to inhibit protease activity in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LU7). We have used extensive screening strategies such as drug likeliness, antiviral activity value prediction, molecular docking, ADME, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM/GBSA. A total of 17 compounds were shortlisted using Lipinski\u2019s rule in which 5 compounds showed significant predicted antiviral activity values. Among these 5, only 2 compounds, Macrolactin A and Stachyflin, showed good binding energy of \u22129.22 and \u22128.00 kcal/mol, respectively, within the binding pocket of the Mpro catalytic residues (HIS 41 and CYS 145). These two compounds were further analyzed to determine their ADME properties. The ADME evaluation of these 2 compounds suggested that they could be effective in developing therapeutic drugs to be used in clinical trials. MD simulations showed that protein\u2013ligand complexes of Macrolactin A and Stachyflin with the target receptor (6LU7) were stable for 100 nanoseconds. The MM/GBSA calculations of Mpro\u2013Macrolactin A complex indicated higher binding free energy (\u221242.58 \u00b1 6.35 kcal/mol). Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) on the residual movement in the MD trajectories further confirmed the stability of Macrolactin A bound state with 6LU7. In conclusion, this study showed that marine natural compound Macrolactin A could be an effective therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 protease (6LU7). Additional in vitro and in vivo validations are strongly needed to determine the efficacy and therapeutic dose of Macrolactin A in biological systems.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12010-021-03608-7.\n\n[end paper 95]\n\n[begin paper 96]\n\nPMCID = 7844105\n\nTitle = Strong Binding of Leupeptin with TMPRSS2 Protease May Be an Alternative to Camostat and Nafamostat for SARS-CoV-2 Repurposed Drug: Evaluation from Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n\nThe unprecedented coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at Wuhan, China, caused acute respiratory infection to humans. There is no precise vaccine/therapeutic agents available to combat the COVID-19 disease. Some repurposed drugs are saving the life of diseased, but the complete cure is relatively less. Several drug targets have been reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in that TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is one of the potential targets; inhibiting this protease stops the virus entry into the host human cell. Camostat mesylate, nafamostat, and leupeptin are the drugs, in which the first two drugs are being used for COVID-19 and leupeptin also tested. To consider these drugs as the repurposed drug for COVID-19, it is essential to understand their binding affinity and stability with TMPRSS2. In the present study, we performed the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of these molecules with the TMPRSS2. The docking study reveals that leupeptin molecule strongly binds with TMPRSS2 protein than the other two drug molecules. The RMSD and RMSF values of MD simulation confirm that leupeptin and the amino acids of TMPRSS2 are very stable than the other two molecules. Furthermore, leupeptin forms interactions with the key amino acids of TMPRSS2 and the same have been maintained during the MD simulations. This structural and dynamical information is useful to evaluate these drugs to be used as repurposed drugs, however, the strong binding profile of leupeptin with TMPRSS2, suggests, it may be considered as a repurposed drug for COVID-19 disease after clinical trial.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12010-020-03475-8.\n\n[end paper 96]\n\n[begin paper 97]\n\nPMCID = 8419828\n\nTitle = Computational approach towards the design of artemisinin\u2013thymoquinone hybrids against main protease of SARS-COV-2\n\nThe sanitary emergency installed in the world, generated by the pandemic of COVID-19, instigates the search for scientific strategies to mitigate the damage caused by the disease to different sectors of society. The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 199 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 4 million died. In this sense, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The main protease (Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2 is an important target, which has been widely studied for antiviral treatment. This work aims to perform a screening of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of synthetic hybrids from thymoquinone and artemisin (THY-ART) against COVID-19.\n\nMolecular docking studies indicated that hybrids of artemisinin and thymoquinone showed a relevant interaction with the active fraction of the enzyme Mpro, when compared to the reference drugs. Furthermore, hybrids show an improvement in the interaction of substances with the enzyme, mainly due to the higher frequency of interactions with the Thr199 residue. ADMET studies indicated that hybrids tend to permeate biological membranes, allowing good human intestinal absorption, with low partition to the central nervous system, potentiation for CYP-450 enzyme inhibitors, low risk of toxicity compared to commercially available drugs, considering mainly mutagenicity and cardiotoxicity, low capacity of hybrids to permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier, high absorption and moderate permeability in Caco-2 cells. In addition, T1\u2013T7 tend to have a better distribution of their available fractions to carry out diffusion and transport across cell membranes, as well as increase the energy of interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 target.\n\nHybrid products of artemisinin and thymoquinone have the potential to inhibit Mpro, with desirable pharmacokinetic and toxicity characteristics compared to commercially available drugs, being indicated for preclinical and subsequent clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2.
