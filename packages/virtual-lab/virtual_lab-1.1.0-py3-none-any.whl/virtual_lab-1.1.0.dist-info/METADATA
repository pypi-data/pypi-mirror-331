The **Virtual Lab** is an AI-human collaboration for science research. In the Virtual Lab, a human researcher works with a team of large language model (LLM) **agents** to perform scientific research. Interaction between the human researcher and the LLM agents occurs via a series of **team meetings**, where all the LLM agents discuss a scientific agenda posed by the human researcher, and **individual meetings**, where the human researcher interacts with a single LLM agent to solve a particular scientific task.

Please see our paper [The Virtual Lab: AI Agents Design New SARS-CoV-2 Nanobodies with Experimental Validation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.11.623004v1) for more details on the Virtual Lab and an application to nanobody design for SARS-CoV-2.


## Virtual Lab for nanobody design

As a real-world demonstration, we applied the Virtual Lab to design nanobodies for one of the latest variants of SARS-CoV-2 (see [nanobody_design](https://github.com/zou-group/virtual-lab/tree/main/nanobody_design)). The Virtual Lab built a computational pipeline consisting of [ESM](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574), [AlphaFold-Multimer](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2), and [Rosetta](https://rosettacommons.org/software/) and used it to design 92 nanobodies that were experimentally validated.

Please see the notebook [nanobody_design/run_nanobody_design.ipynb](https://github.com/zou-group/virtual-lab/blob/main/nanobody_design/run_nanobody_design.ipynb) for an example of how to use the Virtual Lab to create agents and run team and individual meetings.


## Installation

The Virtual Lab can be installed using pip or by cloning the repo and installing the required packages. Installation should only take a couple of minutes.

Optionally, first create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -y -n virtual_lab python=3.12
conda activate virtual_lab
```

The Virtual Lab can be installed via pip.

```bash
pip install virtual-lab
```

To install a local version of the Virtual Lab, clone the repo and then install the package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zou-group/virtual_lab.git
cd virtual_lab
pip install -e .
```


## OpenAI API Key

The Virtual Lab currently uses GPT-4o from OpenAI. Save your OpenAI API key as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. For example, add `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>` to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.
